Read `ecosystem/north-star.md` BEFORE `BACKLOG.md`: the backlog is the complete list, the north star is the order, and ten AUTONOMY items are parked behind named triggers that mostly release on `[#625]`.

## §1 — Drift-flags (THE HEADLINE — surfaced first, not buried)

Produced by the live read-only drift-checks (`audit.py ship-gate`, `validate_git_backlog`,
`validate_doc_claims`, `validate_backlog`). **Re-derive each at read-time — the teeth are in
`PROBES.md` (P4/P6/P7/P9), not in trusting these lines.** This bundle states **no** ship-gate
verdict, WARN count, `[stale]` status, drifted `#id`, or count — those are the probes' live answers.

> **Standing vs NEW — generated, names only.** Three lists computed from `ecosystem/disposition-register.yaml` ∩ this window's own diff. **No verdict, count, stale-disposition line, sha or backlog id appears here** — those are P7/P4/P6/P9's live answers and the evidence block carries them. The frame covers the standing-WARN family only; an organ outside it is the FILL-IN's business, not silently filed as standing.

**Window** — the diff since `docs/handoffs/2026-08-28-dev-knowledge-architect/` was added.

**Dispositioned by the register.** The register already carries an entry for these organs, so a WARN from one is standing unless its evidence signature is new:
- `no_ff_merges`
- `journal_spine_anchor`
- `doc_rot`
- `undeclared_edges`
- `funnel_coverage`

**Dispositioned by absence from the window diff.** This window touched nothing these organs read, so a WARN from one is not this window's doing:
- _(none)_

**NEW-and-undispositioned.** No register entry, and this window DID touch what they read — so a WARN from one of these is this window's, and the note below says which is a decision rather than a defect:
- `reconciled_versions` (reads the registered specs and the docs declaring a `reconciled_with:` edge)
- `fleet_parity` (reads the parity-surface manifest and the surfaces it names)

<!-- FILL-IN:driftflags START (hand-authored — ONE judgment only: name which NEW flag above is a DECISION rather than a defect. The standing-vs-new attribution is GENERATED directly above; do not restate it. Do NOT state the ship-gate verdict, the WARN count, the [stale] status, or any drifted #id/sha — those are P7/P4's LIVE answer; naming a value here re-inverts the anti-bluff contract.) -->**1 · Ten `consumer_at_landing` WARNs cannot clear by citation, and that is structural.** They are the seven frozen batch-D lane contracts, the batch-3 manifest and the codex-fate map. The census pool excludes `docs/audits/` BY DESIGN, so batch machinery citing batch machinery is exactly what that exclusion refuses. Their consumption is real; its evidence is a merge commit, not a citation. Reported, not absorbed.

**2 · The batch-3 manifest is INERT and stays that way.** It carries `status: open` and no `closed_by:`, and `open_batches()` returns `[]` -- a manifest with no `closed_by` *"opens nothing at all"*. `docs/audits/` is immutable so it is not corrected; the ruling applies to the NEXT batch, and the freeze predicate now refuses a dispatch that would repeat it.

**3 · One intake is past its READY threshold.** `docs/intake/2026-07-16-satellite-onboarding-prompts.md`, READY 46 days against the ruled 30, carrying no `review-date:`. This is FM-2 leg (d) working, not a defect -- it is the leg's first live finding and it has been open since the leg armed.

**4 · Pre-existing suite REDs are NOT this window's.** Verified by checking out `66662c70` and re-running the identical node ids; the stale batch-1 fixture (`test_vi_batch1_reproduces_the_wrong_id_citation`) is named in the wave-2 close packet as the architect's.<!-- FILL-IN:driftflags END -->

---

## §2 — Shipped this window (the map — pointer, not re-narration)

<!-- FILL-IN:shipped START (hand-authored — a terse map of what shipped, by #id + ADR, pointing at BACKLOG/JOURNAL; NOT a detailed recap JOURNAL already encodes, §2/RF-6) -->**Batch D, seven lanes, all landed or accounted for** -- and one of them landed by REFUSING. Map: `docs/audits/2026-08-29-technical-batchd-launch-contracts/` (the frozen contracts), `docs/audits/2026-08-30-technical-autonomy-decision-tree.md` (55 findings, 100% routed), `ecosystem/north-star.md` (the arc set), `docs/audits/2026-08-30-technical-window-close-operator-brief.md` (the numbers).

Headline deltas: `CLAUDE.md` **39,147 -> 23,931 B**; FUNNEL HEALTH six `unavailable` -> six real numbers; SDA-1 floors UNCALIBRATED -> `C=3 H=5 M=5 L=2`; terra post-merge OWED -> `C=0 H=3 M=1 L=0`; ADR-114 executed; ADR-81 s45 discharged by ADR-116; ratchet **443 -> 443**.<!-- FILL-IN:shipped END -->

---

## §4 — Next-frontier decisions (the design "why" that travels)

<!-- FILL-IN:frontier START (hand-authored — the open architecture questions + decision context the next session must resume rather than rediscover; the residual's core payload in architect mode) -->**The order is the decision, and it is already made.** Four research lanes independently found one shape -- *this repo is an excellent environment and has no learning signal* -- which yields a sequence with no branch: **metric -> measure -> only then an optimizer**. That is why only 2 of 18 true gaps became rows and ten are parked behind named triggers.

**The open question the next seat inherits** is not *what to build* but *whether `[#625]` discriminates*. Its KEEP condition is falsifiable by design: a deliberately weakened instruction set must FAIL while the intact set passes, and **the config is deleted if it does not discriminate**. A harness that passes everything measures nothing, and the whole downstream arc rests on that one experiment being honest about its own null result.<!-- FILL-IN:frontier END -->

---

## §6 — Task-state (pointer, not narration)

The **BACKLOG is the spec; items are tickets.** Task-state is: a pointer to `BACKLOG.md`, the live
in-progress branches (`git branch -v`), and any **drift-flag** `validate_git_backlog` raises (§1 /
`PROBES.md` P4). Re-narrating item text splits the truth and drifts — the pointer + the drift-flag is
the whole task-state.

# Probe manifest — architect mode: orientation first, then teeth (HANDOFF_PROCESS §5 + §13c)
<!-- scope: meta -->

> **Contract.** Each probe ships a **question + source-locator + verification command** and **no
> answer**. The browser has no file access, so the answers reach it one way only: **CC** runs every
> command against **live state at check-time** via `/handoff-verify`, re-derives ground truth, and
> emits **one evidence block** carrying each row's PASS/FAIL and live evidence. The operator pastes
> that block once (HANDOFF_PROCESS §5 — the v6 one-round-trip boot). **Any FAIL blocks onboarding**,
> and a missing required row is not a pass. Degrade loudly: a moved anchor → WARN `anchor-missing`, re-anchor (never a synthesized
> pass); git/tooling absent → reported *skipped* (degraded coverage visible), never counted as pass.
>
> **Anti-bluff (HANDOFF_PROCESS §5 — a probe that bakes its answer is bluffable, rejected).** This
> manifest **withholds every answer value** by construction: no counts, SHAs, dates, verdicts,
> group-memberships, or orienting lines are stated. That withholding IS the teeth. The pass criterion
> is **"answered from the live source at check-time,"** never "matches a remembered number." Generation
> hints (if any) live in the JOURNAL generation-entry, which the browser never sees — never here. The

>
> > **`SUPPLEMENT.md` is generated EMPTY.** Until the operator fills it (`supplement filled`) the ANSWERS region is empty -> the assembler folds nothing -> the incoming §13(d) operator-context beat fires **FULL** (a full off-repo ask), not the narrowed *"anything changed since?"*.
>
> **Windows note:** `audit.py checks` (P2) can crash mid-listing on a bare cp1252 PowerShell console

> is Python's stdout encoding, shell-independent, so git-bash does **not** avoid it. `ship-gate` (P7)
> can false-RED on `handoff_probes` under PowerShell — **verify in git-bash.**

## P0 — Standing-topic reconciliation (emitted **above** P1 — A7 / R2)

The **standing authorities** a session reconciles against before it plans: the live epic
themes and the live accepted intakes. This was a §13 prose rule and it failed three consecutive
windows — *a rule with no probe has no teeth* — so it is mechanized here. **Deterministic legs
only** (the RM-4 / S3d boundedness law): there is no open-ended adjudication leg, because
whole-set grooming is an **arc, not a probe** (JOURNAL 2026-07-26 (h)). P0c is narrowed to a
**name-match** for exactly that reason (amendment A2): "does the Purpose *serve* this authority"
is a judgment a probe cannot terminate on, and a leg that cannot fail honestly discredits the
block. Same contract as every row below: question + source-locator + command, **no answer**.

| # | Probe (question) | Binds to (primary source) | Why a summary can't answer it | CC verifies via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0a | Quote, **substring-exact**, the theme-preamble line of each **active** `[E#]` epic theme in `BACKLOG.md` — **and** separately confirm the generated backlog is **CURRENT**, not stale. | `BACKLOG.md` `[E#]` theme headers + the preamble line under each | the preamble set drifts on any theme edit, and `BACKLOG.md` is GENERATED since [#436] — a probe that can pass on stale generated content is bluffable, so currency is asserted mechanically, not assumed | `grep -A1 '^## \[E' BACKLOG.md` → each quote substring-matches the live preamble (a paraphrase is a FAIL); **then** `python scripts/gen_task_tree.py --check` exits 0 — a non-zero exit is a FAIL (currency — R2's second assertion) |
| P0b | Enumerate, live, every doc under `docs/intake/` whose frontmatter carries `status: ACCEPTED`, and quote each one's **TITLE line** (its first level-1 `#`-heading). **Titles only.** | `docs/intake/*.md` frontmatter + first heading; area definition at `docs/intake/README.md` | the accepted set and its titles drift on any intake status change; neither the set nor any title appears in this bundle | `grep -l '^status: ACCEPTED' docs/intake/*.md` then read each hit's first heading line |
| P0c | Does **this bundle's own Purpose** NAME at least one authority present in the P0a/P0b enumeration? **No match = FAIL**, route to the escalation ladder. (Whether the Purpose genuinely *serves* that authority is an architect judgment, deliberately outside the mechanical check — amendment A2.) | this bundle's `docs/handoffs/2026-08-31-dev-knowledge-architect/HANDOFF_BOOT.md` Purpose ∩ the live P0a/P0b output | the Purpose is hand-authored per bundle and the authorities are live, so the name-match is computable only after P0a and P0b have both been run | `sed -n '/FILL-IN:purpose/,+1p' docs/handoffs/2026-08-31-dev-knowledge-architect/HANDOFF_BOOT.md` → check it names an authority the P0a/P0b output enumerates; no match = FAIL |

**Honest narrowing (terra H3).** P0b quotes **titles**, not wave/sequence detail: wave content is
unstructured prose today, so quoting it would overclaim determinism (the RM-4 law applied to this
row's own design). Wave-level teeth require the intake schema to first gain a required,
machine-locatable plan-of-record heading — an intake-schema change owned by `docs/intake/README.md`,
offered as an option, not assumed.

## P1 — Orientation (the architect's **first move**, before any mechanism — §13c)

A plain-language "what is this project" is **summary-bluffable** and so fails §5's own bar; a copy of
VISION into the handoff is barred (§2/§3). So orientation is a **forced exact-line read**: the line
enters the session **only** by CC reading the **live** primary source, and the quote must match as a
**substring** (never a paraphrase). The browser has no files, so CC reads live and substring-checks,
and the result arrives in the evidence block. The grep is a **tool** that confirms the frame — **the
backlog navigates** (§13c), not this read.

| # | Probe (question) | Binds to (primary source) | Why a summary can't answer it | CC verifies via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1a | Quote, **substring-exact**, the **opening sentence** of `README.md` `## Vision` — *what .dev-knowledge is*. (ADR-114, Accepted 2026-08-29: `README.md` supersedes `VISION.md` as the hub's canonical purpose document. In a CHILD repo, whose canonical purpose document is still `VISION.md`, re-bind the path — cross-repo probes are re-bound against target surfaces regardless.) | `README.md` `## Vision` | a paraphrase of "what this is" is not a substring; a summary rounds it off | `grep -A4 '^## Vision' README.md` → the quote must be a substring of the live section |
| P1b | Quote, **substring-exact**, the **opening line** of `ARCHITECTURE.md` Ch1 (`## Purpose [CORE]`) — *where this work sits*. | `ARCHITECTURE.md` `## Purpose [CORE]` | the orienting line is in the live file only; a summary holds a gist, not the substring | `sed -n '/^## Purpose \[CORE\]/,+5p' ARCHITECTURE.md` → the quote must be a substring of the live section |

**Gate:** the architect may not proceed to design until it **holds both orienting lines** — read live
by CC, substring-matched. **Then, before design, the operator-context beat fires (§13d):** the browser
asks the operator for **off-repo** context.
This bundle's supplement is **generated EMPTY**, so the beat fires **FULL** — *"what off-repo context: intent, priorities, findings not in the repo, changed decisions?"* — not a narrowed "anything changed since?". (If the operator runs `supplement filled`, its ANSWERS fold in and the beat narrows.)

## Teeth probes (state fidelity — same contract; **answers deliberately withheld, §5**)

| # | Probe (question) | Binds to (primary source) | Why a summary can't answer it | CC verifies via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2 | How many checks are in `ALL_CHECKS`, and what is the registry **name** of the final (last) one? | `ALL_CHECKS` in `scripts/audit.py` | the count + last name drift every time a check lands; a summary rounds/omits both | `python scripts/audit.py checks` (set `PYTHONUTF8=1` on a bare PowerShell console — see the cp1252 note) |
| P3 | What is the current **short HEAD sha**, is the working tree clean, which **branch** is checked out, how many commits is `main` **ahead of / behind** `origin/main` — and does that live branch **match the `Destination` row's branch field** in this bundle's boot header? A mismatch is a **FAIL**: the lane is not where the handoff sent it. | live git ∩ the **Destination** row of `docs/handoffs/2026-08-31-dev-knowledge-architect/HANDOFF_BOOT.md` | the summary holds the generation-time state; this handoff's own commit + the later `/ship` merge move HEAD and push `main` ahead until pushed. The `Destination` branch is declared **ex-ante** at generation while the live branch is read at check-time, so whether they agree is computable only now | `git rev-parse --short HEAD` then `git status -sb` then `git branch --show-current` then `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...main` (the last is REQUIRED: `git status -sb` reports the CHECKED-OUT branch's upstream, not `main` vs `origin/main`, and prints no divergence at all when the branch has no upstream), then compare the live branch against the **Destination** row of `docs/handoffs/2026-08-31-dev-knowledge-architect/HANDOFF_BOOT.md` — mismatch = FAIL |
| P4 | Which backlog `#id`(s) does `validate_git_backlog` flag **right now**, and what is the **full short-sha** (as the validator prints it) of the closing merge for each? | live git ∩ `BACKLOG.md` | the drifted set is computed at answer-time; the sha is high-entropy, documented nowhere in the bundle | `python scripts/validate_git_backlog.py` |
| P5 | Is `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s `last_reviewed` stamp **on/after or before** its last git-commit touch — and what are the **two dates**? | `ARCHITECTURE.md` frontmatter + live git | a *relation* over commits; a summary holds neither date precisely | `git log -1 --format=%cs -- ARCHITECTURE.md` vs the frontmatter stamp |
| P6 | What does `validate_doc_claims` report for **`pytest_collected`** — the doc-claim integer, the live-collected integer, and **do they match**? The claim lives in `ecosystem/doc-counts.md`, **not** `ARCHITECTURE.md` (decoupled by #222). | `ecosystem/doc-counts.md` (`doc=` target) + live pytest | the live count drifts on any test change; neither integer appears in this bundle | `python scripts/validate_doc_claims.py` (the `pytest_collected` line) |
| P7 | Does `audit.py ship-gate` come back **GREEN or RED** right now, **how many WARNs are dispositioned**, and **is there a `[stale]` disposition**? | live git ∩ `main` history ∩ `ecosystem/disposition-register.yaml` | **THIS is the §1 headline** — the GREEN/RED verdict, the dispositioned-WARN count, and any `[stale]` line are computed at answer-time over live git ∩ `main`; a new direct-on-`main` commit re-REDs it; the values are absent from the bundle | `python scripts/audit.py ship-gate` (read the final GREEN/RED verdict + the disposition count + any `[stale]` line) — re-derive; do **not** trust the residual's prose |
| P8 | How many files does a **v5 architect bundle** carry, does it include a **per-bundle `README.md`**, is `SUPPLEMENT.md` present, **is its ANSWERS region empty or filled**, and where does the stable operator boilerplate live instead? | `docs/handoffs/2026-08-31-dev-knowledge-architect/` listing ∩ `HANDOFF_PROCESS.md` §13 | a summary may "remember" a stale file count or the wrong supplement fill-state; the live bundle + spec are the only ground truth | `ls docs/handoffs/2026-08-31-dev-knowledge-architect/` ∩ `grep -A3 'PASTE CHAT ANSWERS' docs/handoffs/2026-08-31-dev-knowledge-architect/SUPPLEMENT.md` (is there substantive text below the divider?) |
| P9 | How many **serialize-groups** does `validate_backlog` summarize **right now**, which `#id`(s) are in the **code-edge** group, and which `#id`s are in the **coherence** group? | `BACKLOG.md` ∩ `scripts/validate_backlog.py` | group membership is a live schema fact that drifts on any BACKLOG edit; it is absent from this bundle | `python scripts/validate_backlog.py` (the serialize-groups summary line) |

## Gate procedure (CC)

1. **Run the whole gate in one pass** (`/handoff-verify`), in table order: **P0 first, then P1**,
   then the remaining rows — every row against **live state now**. Table order IS the execution order. The
   architect cannot begin design until both orienting lines are read live and substring-matched.
   **The operator-context beat (§13d) fires after the block is in hand.**
2. For each, record **PASS** (live ground truth obtained and consistent) or **FAIL** (anchor missing /
   command errored / receiver tried to answer from memory or this bundle).
3. **Any FAIL → ABORT onboarding** and route through the escalation ladder (re-read the named primary
   source → CC re-derives the fact → abort if still unmet).
4. Probes P0a–P9 are *designed to move* between generation and check-time — that is the point. **Answer
   values are deliberately absent (§5)**: the pass criterion is **"answered from the live source,"**
   never "matches a remembered number." P7 is the headline (GREEN/RED + dispositioned-WARN count +
   any `[stale]` line). P8 pins the bundle shape **and the live supplement fill-state**. First check
   which branch is live (P3), then re-derive every load-bearing fact from the live primary source.
5. **Every row is BOUNDED (§5 cond. 4).** A probe whose honest answer requires unbounded judgment
   over an open set is an **arc, not a probe**, and is rejected — `verify_handoff_probes.py` FAILs
   any row that quantifies over one. The former **P10** ("groom every OPEN item in `BACKLOG.md` at
   boot") was exactly that row: ratified-against at intake #18 as this condition's own origin, and
   shipped anyway in 35 bundles until it was removed 2026-08-26. Backlog grooming is real work; it
   is a task the successor takes on with a contract, not a gate it clears before it may begin.
