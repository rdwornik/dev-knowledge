# Handoff boot — session header + paste-pointer (architect mode)
<!-- scope: meta -->

| **Slug** | `2026-08-08-dev-knowledge-architect` |
| **Chat title** | `[dev-knowledge] Technical Architect — 2026-08-08-dev-knowledge-architect · SEQ 1` — name the fresh browser chat this (bump `SEQ` per parallel chat) |
| **Mode** | **architect** (HANDOFF_PROCESS §13 — planning / way-of-working scope) |
| **Purpose** | <!-- FILL-IN:purpose START (hand-authored — ~3 sentences + a BACKLOG pointer; a session HEADER, NOT a second residual; the generator never writes this) -->Plan and dispatch batch 3 under `[E7] Tooling & evaluation`, and take the decisions the 2026-08-06/07 window carried rather than closed — the batch protocol is now versioned repo artifacts (accepted intake "Parallel multi-agent execution system — batch protocol as versioned repo artifacts"), and two batches have run under it, so the open question is no longer whether the channel works but what fills it. Start from the candidate pool and the carried-decision list in `docs/audits/2026-08-08-technical-successor-prep.md` (§3 and §5), which are retrieval, not a plan — the cut is this session's. Task state: `BACKLOG.md`, `[E7]` and `[E2]` first.<!-- FILL-IN:purpose END --> |
| **Destination** | worktree <!-- FILL-IN:dest-worktree START (hand-authored — the worktree name, or `none (primary tree)`) -->none (primary tree)<!-- FILL-IN:dest-worktree END --> · branch `main` · write-scope <!-- FILL-IN:dest-scope START (hand-authored — what this lane may write; PROSE, deliberately outside P3) -->The primary checkout on `main`, as the batch-3 planning and dispatch seat: it may write the batch-3 manifest under `docs/audits/`, birth or re-peg BACKLOG rows through `tasks/`, and record rulings in `protocols/STANDING_RULINGS.md`. It does NOT write inside any lane's footprint once lanes are dispatched — a batch's integrator merges lane branches, it does not author in them — and it does not write into a consumer repo except through the RULING-W shape (consumer worktree/branch → report, never a direct push into a live consumer checkout).<!-- FILL-IN:dest-scope END --> · MODE **architect** — basis <!-- FILL-IN:dest-mode-basis START (hand-authored — WHY this mode, per ADR-87 item 5; PROSE, deliberately outside P3) -->architect: the next session defines what runs, it does not advance a named row. It cuts a batch-3 manifest from a candidate pool, takes six carried decisions that are forks rather than tasks, and re-pegs rows whose locators point at finished events — work whose output is a plan and a set of rulings. Mode selection follows HANDOFF_PROCESS §13 ("define-or-reshape-the-way-of-working → architect"), and the seat boots opus per the amended Ch8 routing matrix, which makes opus the default for any arc touching `.dev-knowledge`.<!-- FILL-IN:dest-mode-basis END --> |
| **Generated at** | Bundle cut by `scripts/gen_handoff.py` from **committed** repo state on branch `docs/handoff-cut-2026-08-08`. This line names only which branch was checked out — it states **no** sha, count, or verdict. **Re-derive HEAD / tree-clean / branch / ahead-behind live** (`PROBES.md` P3). |

> **`SUPPLEMENT.md` is FILLED.** Its ANSWERS fold into `PASTE_THIS.md`; the incoming §13(d) operator-context beat **NARROWS** to *"anything changed since the supplement was written?"*.

> **The `Destination` row is declared ex-ante — a lane inherits none of it from a prior prompt.**
> Only its **branch** field has a mechanical counterpart: `PROBES.md` **P3** compares it against
> live `git branch --show-current`, and a mismatch is a FAIL. Worktree, write-scope and MODE-basis
> stay **prose** and deliberately carry no probe leg — a leg with no mechanical counterpart cannot
> fail honestly, and one that cannot fail honestly discredits the whole block (R3).

> **Anti-bluff in effect.** The contract, what the withholding buys, and where generation-time
> hints go instead are stated **once** in this bundle's own `PROBES.md` header (spec:
> `HANDOFF_PROCESS.md` §5) — one hop inside the same paste, rather than a second copy free to
> disagree with the first.

> **Operator runbook is not copied here.** The stable who-each-file-is-for / run-loop / rationale lives
> **once** in the canonical per-repo runbook **`docs/handoffs/README.md`** — read it for the walkthrough.
> This file carries only the **session header** (above) + the **paste-pointer** (below). v5 bundles carry
> **no per-bundle README** (HANDOFF_PROCESS §13).

> **Dispatch prep is not copied here either.** A seat taking the architect role finds how a dispatch
> prompt is made, how model + effort are routed, how a batch runs, and how completion is managed at
> **`protocols/PLAYBOOK.md` Ch8 "Handoff prep for the next architect"** — itself an index of pointers,
> so this is one hop to the index and one more to each home. Standing rulings applied without asking:
> `protocols/STANDING_RULINGS.md`. Same pointer-not-copy rule as the runbook above.

## What the operator does (paste-pointer)

1. Open a fresh Claude.ai chat.
2. Paste **`PASTE_THIS.md`** (in this bundle directory) — the browser role file + residual + probes (+ the
   supplement ANSWERS **only if filled**), assembled in order by `scripts/assemble_paste.py`. One paste;
   never hand-feed individual files to the file-less browser.
3. The browser replies with its on-load acknowledgment line (it names the Layer-1 actor); a partial or
   missing paste is then visible.
4. **architect mode** — the browser adopts the mode posture from `protocols/HANDOFF_BOOT.md` (§"architect
   mode"): orient first, ask the operator for off-repo context, drive decomposition, hold the whole-system view, surface design tensions — not the reactive-filter default.
5. **Ask CC for `/handoff-verify`, then paste its ONE evidence block.** CC runs the *whole* gate —
   every `PROBES.md` row, the orientation reads, the inherited claims — against live state at
   check-time, and emits a single table. You paste it **once**. The browser reads the table; it does
   not dictate commands one at a time (HANDOFF_PROCESS §5, the v6 one-round-trip boot).
6. **Then the operator-context beat (§13d).** The supplement is **FILLED**; its ANSWERS are in the paste, so the beat **NARROWS** to *"anything changed since the supplement was written?"*.
7. Hand `RESIDUAL.md` — **drift-flags first** (the §1 headline) — then the **next-frontier decisions**
   (§4) + the **shipped-this-window** map (§2). The probe answers are already in the evidence block
   from step 5. **Any FAIL there blocks onboarding** (the escalation ladder); a missing required row
   is not a pass. **The bundle states no drift-flag value — the block carries them, re-derived live.**

## Why a pointer, not a copy

The methodology, the browser role, and the operator runbook all live in the repo and are referenced by
**pointer**; CC (which holds the repo) serves any part the file-less browser needs just-in-time.
`PASTE_THIS.md` is the assembled boot source (generated by `scripts/assemble_paste.py`, never hand-edited);
`docs/handoffs/README.md` is the operator runbook. If a pointer and its source disagree, the source wins —
fix the pointer or regenerate `PASTE_THIS.md`.
