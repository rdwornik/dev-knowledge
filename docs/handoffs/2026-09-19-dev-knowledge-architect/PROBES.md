# Probe manifest — architect mode: orientation first, then teeth (HANDOFF_PROCESS §5 + §13c)
<!-- scope: meta -->

> **Contract, rationale, execution order, escalation ladder: `protocols/HANDOFF_PROCESS.md` §5 —
> there ONCE ([#611]).** Every row ships a **question + source-locator + command**, never an
> answer. CC runs the whole set against live state via `/handoff-verify` and emits **one evidence
> block**. **Any FAIL blocks onboarding; a missing required row is not a pass.** Table order IS
> execution order. Cut on `main` — which branch, not a value; re-derive live (P3). Run
> with `PYTHONUTF8=1`, and verify `ship-gate` (P7) in git-bash — a bare cp1252 PowerShell console
> false-REDs `handoff_probes`.

## P0 — Standing-topic reconciliation (above P1 — A7 / R2; rationale §5)

| # | Probe (question) | Binds to (primary source) | Why a summary can't answer it | CC verifies via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0a | Quote, **substring-exact**, the theme-preamble line of each **active** `[E#]` theme in `BACKLOG.md`, and confirm the generated backlog is **CURRENT**. | `BACKLOG.md` `[E#]` theme headers + each preamble line | preambles drift on any theme edit, and a generated file can be stale | `grep -A1 '^## \[E' BACKLOG.md` → each quote substring-matches (a paraphrase FAILs); then `python scripts/gen_task_tree.py --check` exits 0 |
| P0b | Enumerate live the docs under `docs/intake/` with `status: ACCEPTED`, and quote each one's **TITLE line**. Titles only (§5). | `docs/intake/*.md` frontmatter + first heading; areas at `docs/intake/README.md` | the set and its titles drift on any status change; neither is in this bundle | `grep -l '^status: ACCEPTED' docs/intake/*.md` then read each hit's first heading |
| P0c | Does this bundle's **Purpose** NAME an authority the P0a/P0b enumeration returned? No match = **FAIL**. | `docs/handoffs/2026-09-19-dev-knowledge-architect/HANDOFF_BOOT.md` Purpose ∩ live P0a/P0b output | Purpose is hand-authored, the authorities are live; computable only after P0a and P0b run | `sed -n '/FILL-IN:purpose/,+1p' docs/handoffs/2026-09-19-dev-knowledge-architect/HANDOFF_BOOT.md` → it names an enumerated authority, or FAILs |

## P1 — Orientation (the architect's **first move** — §13c)

| # | Probe (question) | Binds to (primary source) | Why a summary can't answer it | CC verifies via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1a | Quote, **substring-exact**, the opening sentence of `README.md` `## Vision` — what .dev-knowledge is. In a child repo still on `VISION.md`, re-bind the path (ADR-114). | `README.md` `## Vision` | a paraphrase is not a substring; a summary rounds it off | `grep -A4 '^## Vision' README.md` → the quote must be a substring |
| P1b | Quote, **substring-exact**, the opening line of `ARCHITECTURE.md` Ch1 (`## Purpose [CORE]`) — where this work sits. | `ARCHITECTURE.md` `## Purpose [CORE]` | the line is in the live file only; a summary holds a gist | `sed -n '/^## Purpose \[CORE\]/,+5p' ARCHITECTURE.md` → the quote must be a substring |

**Gate:** no design until both orienting lines are held, read live and substring-matched. Then the
operator-context beat fires (§13d).
The operator has **filled** the supplement, so its ANSWERS are in the paste and the beat **NARROWS** to *"anything changed since the supplement was written?"*.

## Teeth probes (state fidelity — answers withheld, §5)

| # | Probe (question) | Binds to (primary source) | Why a summary can't answer it | CC verifies via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2 | How many checks are in `ALL_CHECKS`, and what is the registry **name** of the last one? | `ALL_CHECKS` in `scripts/audit.py` | count and last name drift every time a check lands | `python scripts/audit.py checks` |
| P3 | Short **HEAD sha**, tree clean?, **branch** checked out, `main` **ahead/behind** `origin/main` — and does the live branch match the **Destination** row's branch field? Mismatch = **FAIL**. | live git ∩ the **Destination** row of `docs/handoffs/2026-09-19-dev-knowledge-architect/HANDOFF_BOOT.md` | Destination is declared ex-ante, the branch is read now | `git rev-parse --short HEAD`, `git status -sb`, `git branch --show-current`, `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...main` (the fourth leg is REQUIRED — §5), then compare against `docs/handoffs/2026-09-19-dev-knowledge-architect/HANDOFF_BOOT.md` |
| P4 | Which `#id`(s) does `validate_git_backlog` flag **now**, and the **full short-sha** of each closing merge? | live git ∩ `BACKLOG.md` | the set is computed at answer-time; the sha is high-entropy and in no document | `python scripts/validate_git_backlog.py` |
| P5 | Is `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s `last_reviewed` **on/after or before** its last commit touch — and the **two dates**? | `ARCHITECTURE.md` frontmatter + live git | a relation over commits; a summary holds neither date precisely | `git log -1 --format=%cs -- ARCHITECTURE.md` vs the frontmatter stamp |
| P6 | What does `validate_doc_claims` report for **`pytest_collected`** — doc integer, live integer, do they match? | `ecosystem/doc-counts.md` (`doc=` target) + live pytest | the live count drifts on any test change; neither integer is in this bundle | `python scripts/validate_doc_claims.py` (the `pytest_collected` line) |
| P7 | Is `audit.py ship-gate` **GREEN or RED** now, **how many WARNs are dispositioned**, any `[stale]` disposition? | live git ∩ `main` history ∩ `ecosystem/disposition-register.yaml` | the §1 headline, computed at answer-time; one direct-on-`main` commit re-REDs it | `python scripts/audit.py ship-gate` — read the verdict, the disposition count, any `[stale]` line; do **not** trust the residual's prose |
| P8a | File count of this bundle, is `SUPPLEMENT.md` present, ANSWERS empty or filled — and does each filled answer **CITE A FILE** (repo or transport path) rather than a chat turn? Chat-only = **FAIL** (§5). | `docs/handoffs/2026-09-19-dev-knowledge-architect/` listing ∩ `protocols/HANDOFF_PROCESS.md` §13 | a summary holds a stale count or fill-state; the citation form is readable only in the live text | `ls docs/handoffs/2026-09-19-dev-knowledge-architect/` ∩ `grep -A3 'PASTE CHAT ANSWERS' docs/handoffs/2026-09-19-dev-knowledge-architect/SUPPLEMENT.md` — substantive text below the divider, each answer naming a path |
| P8b | For the transport's `STATUS-<seat>.md` files: each one's **byte size**, and is its **first `## ` heading** the "now" section? Over **5,000 bytes**, or a first heading that is not "now", = **FAIL** (§5 — the threshold is bytes, not an ambiguous "5 KB"). | the live transport dir ∩ the grammar table in `protocols/OPERATOR-INTERFACE.md` `## 1. File exchange goes through the Downloads directory` | these belong to files written after this bundle was cut | `ls -l "$env:CLAUDE_PROMPTS_DIR/to-browser"` then `grep -n -m1 '^## '` per hit — report size + first heading each |
| P9 | How many **serialize-groups** does `validate_backlog` summarize **now**, and which `#id`s are in the **code-edge** and **coherence** groups? | `BACKLOG.md` ∩ `scripts/validate_backlog.py` | group membership drifts on any BACKLOG edit and is absent here | `python scripts/validate_backlog.py` (the serialize-groups line) |
| P11 | For the window's decision files on the transport (`DECLARE-`, `AMEND-`, `BATCH-` prefixes): does a **flush-left `carried-by:`** appear in the file HEAD, and does its value name a repo home that **resolves on `main`** or state the literal `OPEN` (an `OPEN` being named in this bundle's residual)? Neither = **FAIL**. **Anchored and valued — a bare substring match is NOT this check** (§5). | the live transport dir ∩ `protocols/HANDOFF_PROCESS.md` §5 ∩ `docs/handoffs/2026-09-19-dev-knowledge-architect/RESIDUAL.md` | written after this bundle is cut: neither the file set, nor a carrier value, nor the residual's naming of them exists here | in the transport dir, per decision file: `head -6 "$f" \| grep -m1 -E '^carried-by:'` — an empty result is the FAIL set (the HEAD window and the `^` anchor are both load-bearing; `grep -l` over the whole file is a different and broken check, §5). Then take the value: `git cat-file -e main:<path>` for a path, else match the literal `OPEN` in `docs/handoffs/2026-09-19-dev-knowledge-architect/RESIDUAL.md`. Report per file WHICH value resolved and from where |

## Gate procedure (CC)

`protocols/HANDOFF_PROCESS.md` §5 — "Who runs it" + "Execution order" ([#611]). Table order IS the
execution order.
