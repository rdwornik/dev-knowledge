# Handoff boot — session header + paste-pointer (architect mode)

The decision this session owes is whether `[#501]`'s BUILD takes its ~5 coupled-gate conformances by precedent in the same commit, and whether `[#504]`'s owed terra review gates its merge.

| **Destination** | worktree <!-- FILL-IN:dest-worktree START (hand-authored — the worktree name, or `none (primary tree)`) -->`none (primary tree)` — all mutations serial, matching the window just sealed<!-- FILL-IN:dest-worktree END --> · branch `main` · write-scope <!-- FILL-IN:dest-scope START (hand-authored — what this lane may write; PROSE, deliberately outside P3) -->`tasks/` + regen (never `BACKLOG.md` by hand), `docs/decisions/` if an ADR is ruled, `JOURNAL.md`; `.github/workflows/` ONLY if `[#501]` BUILD is authorized this session<!-- FILL-IN:dest-scope END --> · MODE **architect** — basis <!-- FILL-IN:dest-mode-basis START (hand-authored — WHY this mode, per ADR-87 item 5; PROSE, deliberately outside P3) -->the owed decisions are sequencing and scope calls across four fresh rows, not execution of a settled spec; `[#501]` also carries a new-top-level-tree event whose blast radius is a judgment, and ADR-87 item 5 puts that class in architect<!-- FILL-IN:dest-mode-basis END --> |
| **Generated at** | Bundle cut by `scripts/gen_handoff.py` from **committed** repo state on branch `docs/handoff-2026-08-06-consolidation`. This line names only which branch was checked out — it states **no** sha, count, or verdict. **Re-derive HEAD / tree-clean / branch / ahead-behind live** (`PROBES.md` P3). |

> **`SUPPLEMENT.md` is generated EMPTY.** Until the operator fills it (`supplement filled`) the ANSWERS region is empty -> the assembler folds nothing -> the incoming §13(d) operator-context beat fires **FULL** (a full off-repo ask), not the narrowed *"anything changed since?"*.

> **The `Destination` row is declared ex-ante — a lane inherits none of it from a prior prompt.**
> Only its **branch** field has a mechanical counterpart: `PROBES.md` **P3** compares it against
> live `git branch --show-current`, and a mismatch is a FAIL. Worktree, write-scope and MODE-basis
> stay **prose** and deliberately carry no probe leg — a leg with no mechanical counterpart cannot
> fail honestly, and one that cannot fail honestly discredits the whole block (R3).

> **Anti-bluff in effect (read `PROBES.md` header).** This bundle **withholds every probe answer
> value** by construction — no counts, SHAs, dates, verdicts, or orienting lines. The withholding IS
> the teeth; run the commands. Generation-time drift hints live in the JOURNAL generation-entry, which
> the browser never sees — never in this bundle.

> **Operator runbook is not copied here.** The stable who-each-file-is-for / run-loop / rationale lives
> **once** in the canonical per-repo runbook **`docs/handoffs/README.md`** — read it for the walkthrough.
> This file carries only the **session header** (above) + the **paste-pointer** (below). v5 bundles carry
> **no per-bundle README** (HANDOFF_PROCESS §13).

## What the operator does (paste-pointer)

1. Open a fresh Claude.ai chat.
2. Paste **`PASTE_THIS.md`** (in this bundle directory) — the browser role file + residual + probes (+ the
   supplement ANSWERS **only if filled**), assembled in order by `scripts/assemble_paste.py`. One paste;
   never hand-feed individual files to the file-less browser.
3. The browser replies with its on-load acknowledgment line (it names the Layer-1 actor); a partial or
   missing paste is then visible.
4. **architect mode** — the browser adopts the mode posture from `protocols/HANDOFF_BOOT.md` (§"architect
   mode"): orient first, ask the operator for off-repo context, drive decomposition, hold the whole-system view, surface design tensions — not the reactive-filter default.
5. **Ask CC for `/handoff-verify`, then paste its ONE evidence block.** CC runs the *whole* gate —
   every `PROBES.md` row, the orientation reads, the inherited claims — against live state at
   check-time, and emits a single table. You paste it **once**. The browser reads the table; it does
   not dictate commands one at a time (HANDOFF_PROCESS §5, the v6 one-round-trip boot).
6. **Then the operator-context beat (§13d).** The supplement is **generated EMPTY**, so unless the operator fills it first the beat fires **FULL**: *"what off-repo context — intent, priorities, findings not in the repo, changed decisions?"*
7. Hand `RESIDUAL.md` — **drift-flags first** (the §1 headline) — then the **next-frontier decisions**
   (§4) + the **shipped-this-window** map (§2). The probe answers are already in the evidence block
   from step 5. **Any FAIL there blocks onboarding** (the escalation ladder); a missing required row
   is not a pass. **The bundle states no drift-flag value — the block carries them, re-derived live.**

## Why a pointer, not a copy

The methodology, the browser role, and the operator runbook all live in the repo and are referenced by
**pointer**; CC (which holds the repo) serves any part the file-less browser needs just-in-time.
`PASTE_THIS.md` is the assembled boot source (generated by `scripts/assemble_paste.py`, never hand-edited);
`docs/handoffs/README.md` is the operator runbook. If a pointer and its source disagree, the source wins —
fix the pointer or regenerate `PASTE_THIS.md`.
