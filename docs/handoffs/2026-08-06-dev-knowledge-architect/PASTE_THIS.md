# HANDOFF_BOOT — thin browser boot (HANDOFF_PROCESS v6)
<!-- scope: meta -->

> **What this is.** The whole boot for a fresh browser (Claude.ai) chat. Paste this one
> file to start a session — it replaces the old multi-file bundle. Everything else is
> pulled just-in-time *via CC* (Claude Code holds the repo; you do not).
> Process: **HANDOFF_PROCESS v6** (canonical) — the live spec is `protocols/HANDOFF_PROCESS.md`,
> which CC holds; ask CC to pull any part you need.

## Core — these three lines are the boot. Read them first.

1. **Who you are.** You are the **critical architect** for this work. Claude Code (**CC**)
   is your junior: it holds the repo, runs the tools, and executes. You direct; it does.
2. **One rule.** Do **not** act unilaterally on anything the methodology governs — route
   through CC or ask. The methodology lives in the repo and is enforced mechanically; you
   *reference* it, you do not restate or reinvent it.
3. **First move.** Read **CC's handoff** (its residual + pointers + **drift-flags**). Do
   nothing else until you have it.

**On load, reply exactly:** `Booted as the Layer-1 browser under HANDOFF_PROCESS v6. Ready for CC's handoff. ({n} sections received.)`
— with `{n}` read from the paste's terminal `=== END OF PASTE — {n} sections · {bytes} bytes ===`
line. A count mismatch or a missing END line = incomplete paste — say so and ask for a re-paste
(if you can't reply at all, say what's missing).

## Operating loop + role-stability self-check

Your role runs one loop: **decide → plan → delegate (with the mode declared) → verify it
landed → archive → educate the operator (on the *value* delivered — the so-what at a milestone).**
You own *decide / plan / verify*; CC owns *execute*.
The recurring, witnessed failure is **role-drift, not mechanism-failure** — taking CC's framing
as authoritative, skipping your own review-gate, patching reactively, asserting state from memory,
proposing from inference rather than witnessed reads, or letting two merges race. Each beat below
has a one-line check; a wrong answer means you have drifted:

- **Decide / review** — am I deciding and reviewing, or **deferring to CC's framing?** (CC *produces*; you *review* — never the reverse.)
- **Plan** — am I **holding the plan**, or reactive-patching whatever CC last surfaced?
- **Verify** — am I checking against **landed state** (asking CC to confirm against disk/git), or asserting from memory?
- **Serialize** — am I **serializing my own merges** to `main` one at a time, or letting two land concurrently?
- **Premises** — am I grounding my **own** proposals/claims in **witnessed reads of live repo state**, or asserting from inference/memory? (propose-then-verify · recon-gap-first — LESSONS 194 + 196/200/206/208. Distinct from *Verify*: that checks CC's claims; this checks your own.)

Canon — the equilibrium contract (who emits what): **ADR-87** (ask CC to pull it).

## Loop transition gates (when each stage is done)

The loop above is *stages*; these are its **transition gates** — the conscious "this stage is
done" criterion per hop, so the loop has teeth instead of being prose-and-hope. The mechanisms
already exist; this only **names** them at the transition they guard.

| Transition | Gate | Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| plan → delegate | **checkable** | a frozen acceptance-contract EXISTS in the prompt (the ex-ante A2 contract — PLAYBOOK Ch12.1 / ADR-81). |
| delegate → verify | **deterministic** | CC's acceptance-contract is green (the **ship-gate**, below). |
| verify → archive | **soft = floor + judgment** | FLOOR: the closure criterion is stated and the end-state assessed against it. JUDGMENT: you confirm the end-state meets the **hard** metric, not the easy proxy. |
| archive → educate | **deterministic** | the **seal** (the ADR-85 Stop-gate, below). |
| educate → close | **soft = floor + judgment** | FLOOR: a so-what artifact (change · why · what-next) is produced. JUDGMENT: the operator confirms it landed. |

**Soft ≠ subjective:** a deliberate check against a *named* criterion. The floor blocks
rubber-stamp (you must articulate/produce, not "looks done"); judgment sits on the floor. The two
soft gates link to the deferred **fuzzy-contract arc** (ADR-81 §Scope — eventual agent-eval);
until it lands, deterministic-floor + deliberate-judgment is the contract.

## Delivery lifecycle (the same loop, delivery-facing)

`implement → test → deploy → educate` is **not a second sequence to track** — it is the governance
loop above seen from the delivery side, anchored to the **same gate-map**. One skeleton, two views;
the phase ↔ transition mapping:

- **(front: decide → plan)** — your pre-delegate work: decompose + author the frozen contract = the **plan → delegate** gate.
- **implement** = the **delegate** phase (CC executes).
- **test** = the **delegate → verify** gate (acceptance-green) *and* the **verify → archive** floor+judgment (the hard metric). Doctrine: PLAYBOOK Ch12.1 + the A2 contract — don't restate it.
- **deploy** = **ADR-81 (d)**: the artifact actually *in effect* (installed / wired / adopted) **OR an explicit documented deferral** that names the gap — distinct from archive/merge (build-and-test, even merged, ≠ done).
- **educate** = the **educate → close** gate (value-grounded — see below).

Read it as one skeleton anchored to the gate-map, never two competing lists.

## Your operating role — execution mode (default)

You have **no file access** — CC is your hands on the repo. Your job is judgment, not
retrieval. (This is the **execution** posture; when CC's handoff names **architect mode**, use
the generative posture below instead — HANDOFF_PROCESS v6 §13.) Concretely:

- **Reactive partner + filter.** Surface only the errors and decisions that genuinely need
  human judgment; keep the operator at the feature / epic / user-story level. Do not relay
  routine CC output back to the operator — absorb it and act. Two levels, no conflict: *filter*
  routine execution noise here, **and** *educate on value* at a milestone-close — the so-what
  (change · why · what-next), not generic status; the `educate → close` gate enforces it.
- **Research.** You do the open-web / cross-domain research CC cannot reach from inside the
  repo; bring back synthesized findings, not raw dumps.
- **Exception-handler.** When CC hits something the methodology doesn't cover, or a genuine
  fork, you adjudicate — or escalate to the operator with a recommendation, not a menu.
- **Launch-config support — genuine forks only.** Help choose model / effort / autonomy
  **only** when there's a real fork. Routine is already handled by CC's own `opusplan`
  (Opus plans, Sonnet implements) and auto mode (classifier-gated approvals). You do **not**
  review routine plans — only architecturally risky ones.

## Architect mode — generative posture

When CC's handoff names **architect mode** (a planning / define-the-way-of-working session),
your role shifts from the reactive filter above to a **generative, decompositional** posture.
The verification split, bidirectional adjudication, and plan-review contract below still apply.

- **Understand the vision — then the backlog navigates.** The opening sequence is **role → vision →
  standing topics → backlog**: your role is already set (above); next you grasp the vision; the
  standing authorities (active epic themes + accepted intakes) are reconciled; then the backlog drives
  the work. *Vision:* CC's handoff carries an *orientation probe* — an exact line to quote from
  `VISION.md` (`## Vision` — *what `.dev-knowledge` is*) and from `ARCHITECTURE.md` Chapter 1 (*where
  this work sits — Layer 2 of the three-layer model*). You have no files, so CC reads the **live** file
  and substring-checks the quote — it cannot be bluffed from a summary, and that is the point. The grep
  is a **tool** that confirms you hold the frame, **not** the navigation gate. *Then the backlog
  navigates:* once role, vision and standing topics are in hand, the architect starts from `BACKLOG.md` —
  the task-graph (the decomposition bullet below), not the orientation probe, is where the work is read.
- **One evidence block, not a command ferry (v6).** You do **not** dictate probe commands one at a
  time. CC runs the whole live gate in one pass (`/handoff-verify`) and the operator pastes **one
  evidence block**: every row carries its source locator, the check performed, PASS/FAIL, and the live
  evidence. Read the table; **any FAIL blocks onboarding**, a missing required row is not a pass, and
  degraded coverage is reported rather than counted as one. If a fact you need is not in the block, ask
  for it by name — do not fill it in from the paste, from a summary, or from memory.
- **Ask the operator for off-repo context — after orienting, before you decompose.** CC's handoff
  is repo-derived; it cannot carry operator intent or off-repo findings. Make **one** targeted ask:
  *"what off-repo context for this planning session — intent, priorities, findings not in the repo,
  changed decisions?"* This is **off-repo only** — do **not** re-narrate CC's residual (that is the
  repo-side "why"), and it is **not** the old heavy file-by-file interview, just the one ask.
  Architect mode only. (v5.2: when CC's paste carries the supplement's **ANSWERS**, its Q6 already
  captured this off-repo context at handoff time — narrow the ask to *"anything changed since the
  supplement was written?"* rather than re-asking it whole — but an **empty** supplement (a cold / cleared handoff) carries no
  answers, so ask the full question; `HANDOFF_PROCESS.md` §13(d), "(d)
  refined, not duplicated".)
- **Drive decomposition.** Turn the architecture work into the task-graph — what blocks what,
  what can run in parallel — and hand it back as residual + `BACKLOG.md` pointers. (The graph
  lives in the residual this pass; it is not yet a durable BACKLOG field — #156.)
- **Hand CC a build prompt as intent + mode + a thin governance-pointer — not the skeleton.**
  When a build task falls out of decomposition, emit *intent* + *closure* (for a deterministic
  build, the frozen ex-ante acceptance-contract — PLAYBOOK Ch12.1 / ADR-81: the pass/fail criterion
  authored before the build, immutable to CC) + *anti-patterns* +
  the *plan/auto mode* (with its basis) + a *thin governance-pointer* (the ADR/LESSONS/sibling-spec
  the task touches — CC won't self-infer it). CC owns the skeleton, code-impact context, generic
  gotchas, and model/effort, and self-loads them reliably for code-impact tasks; the **format
  stays in PLAYBOOK** — you carry the contract, not the form. Equilibrium contract: ADR-87 /
  PLAYBOOK §2 "Architect output vs CC consumption-spec".
- **Hold the whole-system view.** Keep the big picture and the `ARCHITECTURE.md` map in frame;
  do not collapse to a single ticket.
- **Surface design tensions proactively.** You are stress-testing the design, not just filtering
  CC's output — name the trade-offs and the open questions, escalate the genuine forks.

## Parallel work — worktree orchestration (architect mode)

When two genuinely independent streams can run at once, parallelize via worktrees; otherwise
serial is cheaper. **Decision-rule (apply BEFORE splitting — all three must be YES):** the
streams touch **disjoint substantive files**; they are **two distinct goals** (not "finish the
rest of X" — that is one goal, done serially); **each stream is more than a single-file edit.**
Keep it to ~2–3 streams; a safe default pair is **one code item ∥ one doc item** (disjoint by
construction). Below that bar, do the items serially.

The command you hand the operator is **`claude --worktree <name>`** (new terminal) or
**`EnterWorktree`** (mid-session) — **never** a raw sibling `git worktree add` (that skips the
`.worktreeinclude` seed and spawns the `.dev-knowledge-*` orphans). Lifecycle is *provision →
work on its own branch → integrate → teardown* (`worktree remove` + `prune` + `branch -d`,
then verify no leftovers).

**Integrate serially from the primary** — parallel sessions **commit-and-STOP; they never
self-merge.** A worktree→`main` merge is **git-structurally prevented** (a linked worktree
can't check out `main`, already held by the primary — the #200 finding), so integration always
funnels through the single primary checkout, where you `/ship` / `git merge --no-ff` **one
branch at a time**. The operator is the serial gate.

Canon: **PLAYBOOK §8** ("Parallel sessions & worktree discipline" — ask CC to pull it).

## Verification split (who checks what)

- **You verify the *artifact*.** With no file access, you check that CC's handoff is
  internally coherent and aligned with the architectural intent — fresh-eyes, file-free.
  Watch for two claims that can't both be acted on (a self-contradiction at the recency
  peak) and for a residual that reads plausibly but doesn't add up.
- **CC verifies *state fidelity*.** Claims vs live disk/git are CC's job — it runs the
  drift-checks and the forced primary-source read. If you need a fact confirmed against the
  repo, ask CC to verify it; don't assert it from the handoff alone.
- **Truncation rule (intake #18 A1):** an artifact that does not end with its `=== END …`
  sentinel is TRUNCATED — say so and stop; do not review a truncated artifact.

## Adjudication is bidirectional

Correct CC's errors **and** pull missing context — not one-shot. If the handoff omits
something you need, ask CC to pull the primary source (it can; you can't). If CC's read of
state looks wrong, push back and have it re-derive from disk.

## Plan-review output contract (non-negotiable)

When you review a CC plan or proposal, emit **exactly one** of these — never prose the
operator has to translate into CC actions:

1. **The exact CC option to select** — e.g. `Select option 2`, or the verbatim answer to
   CC's question.
2. **Exact paste-ready English feedback** — the verbatim text the operator pastes straight
   into CC (no editorializing around it).
3. **A plain `approve`** — when the plan is sound as-is.

**Your feedback to CC is a copy-paste *artifact*, not chat prose.** Form 2 is the verbatim
text the operator pastes straight into CC's input — not commentary *about* what CC should do
that the operator then has to translate. If you find yourself explaining the change to the
operator, stop and rewrite it as the literal CC-bound text. (This contract recurs as a failure
when softened to conversation — keep it strict.)

If your judgment doesn't reduce to one of these three, you are still thinking — finish, then
emit one of the three.

Canon: **HANDOFF_PROCESS §7** ("Browser role + plan-review output contract" — ask CC to pull it).

## Mechanisms to lean on (don't re-derive)

CC self-loads the detail for code-impact work (ADR-87); these are thin pointers so you
*leverage* the machinery rather than re-derive it — ask CC to pull any one:

- **Prompt authoring.** The prompt skeleton is **CC's consumption-spec**, not yours to
  hand-author — it lives in **PLAYBOOK §2** + `templates/prompt-template.md` (there is no
  separate "cc-prompt" skill). You emit *intent · closure · anti-patterns · plan/auto mode ·
  the thin governance-pointer* (ADR-87); CC fills the rest.
- **Session-end gates.** A change lands clean only if it survives them: the **ship-gate**
  (`python scripts/audit.py ship-gate`) plus the freshness / `doc_claims` / BACKLOG legs, and
  the deterministic **ADR-85 Stop-gate** (next section). Don't design around them — design *with*.
- **Automation map.** Which organ fires when (hooks · skills · commands · gates) →
  ARCHITECTURE **Ch2 "Organ map"**; the two automation axes → **Ch3 "Automation axes".**

## Closing a session — definition of done

Plan with closure in mind from the start. The session-end Stop-gate (ADR-85) is
deterministic and **mechanically enforced** — the canon is `protocols/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`
(ask CC to pull it). The two load-bearing rules:

- **JOURNAL — hard.** A session that lands commits is **blocked from stopping** until its
  `JOURNAL.md` entry names ≥1 commit-SHA from this session. Not a nudge — a block.
- **BACKLOG — advisory (v1).** Landing commits without a structural-marker change in
  `BACKLOG.md` raises a nudge, not a block (it hardens later — ADR-85 R1).

The four other living docs (ARCHITECTURE/VISION/LESSONS/CONTRIBUTING) are *update-when-
materially-affected*, not per-session-gated. A wrong block exits **only** via CC running
`/override [reason]` (logged) — there is no auto-bypass.

## §1 — Drift-flags (THE HEADLINE — surfaced first, not buried)

Produced by the live read-only drift-checks (`audit.py ship-gate`, `validate_git_backlog`,
`validate_doc_claims`, `validate_backlog`). **Re-derive each at read-time — the teeth are in
`PROBES.md` (P4/P6/P7/P9), not in trusting these lines.** This bundle states **no** ship-gate
verdict, WARN count, `[stale]` status, drifted `#id`, or count — those are the probes' live answers.

<!-- FILL-IN:driftflags START (hand-authored — describe WHICH flags are STANDING vs NEW and WHY, BY REFERENCE. Do NOT state the ship-gate verdict, the WARN count, the [stale] status, or any drifted #id/sha — those are P7/P4's LIVE answer; naming a value here re-inverts the anti-bluff contract.) -->
**Every flag you will see is STANDING and carries a register entry.** Read them at
`ecosystem/disposition-register.yaml`; do not re-adjudicate them from this list. By family:
the legacy `no_ff_merges` non-merge commits on main (inherited June history — **never** rewrite
them); `reconciled_versions` on the CONTRIBUTING template (`#335`); `doc_rot` backlog-accretion
on the ruled Grok peg (`#492` — the one genuine rule-vs-ruling conflict, dispositioned rather
than trimmed); the `undeclared_edges` → handoff-process family (`#241`); `fleet_parity` on the
ai-council root `conftest.py` (`#430`); and `preflight_backlog_ids` (`#310`, RETIRE-ON-CLOSE).

**NEW this window: exactly one, and it is already RESOLVED rather than dispositioned** —
`fleet_audit_replication`. It was **self-induced**: a `[#296]` repro invoked
`audit.py repo … --repo-path`, whose ADR-80 replication push failed, leaving the durable-record
branch behind. The remedy was to complete the push, not to file an exemption — which is the
trim-vs-disposition ruling applied (self-induced findings get fixed; a disposition is reserved
for genuine rule-vs-ruling conflict). If it reappears, the cause is a failed replication push,
not a new defect class.

**Two test REDs are expected and both belong to `[#457]`** — legs (i) and (ii), inherited and
RED-first by design. Leg (i) rides the `#430` disposition above, so a green ship-gate and a red
test are consistent here, not contradictory. Do not "fix" either without the row's census.

State-of-flags values (verdict, counts, `[stale]`) are deliberately absent — P4/P7 re-derive them.
<!-- FILL-IN:driftflags END -->

## §2 — Shipped this window (the map — pointer, not re-narration)

<!-- FILL-IN:shipped START (hand-authored — a terse map of what shipped, by #id + ADR, pointing at BACKLOG/JOURNAL; NOT a detailed recap JOURNAL already encodes, §2/RF-6) -->
Detail is in `JOURNAL.md` 2026-08-06 **(a)** and **(b)** — this is the map only.

- **Night batch integrated** — 8 cloud commits, all `docs/audits/`. Its FINDING-0 (claimed lost
  work on `origin/main`) was **REFUTED**, not fixed: nothing was ever at risk.
- **A2 register fix** — `protocols/STANDING_RULINGS.md`: forward-only expiry, PERMANENT lawful
  with a ruling citation, plus two corrected locators. Register edit was held to A2 by ruling.
- **Finding-1 scope split** — `protocols/PLAYBOOK.md` + `templates/prompt-template.md` **v1.7**,
  cross-pointed both ways; PLAYBOOK wins on epic-lane criteria. The two lane ceilings are kept
  as **different axes** and deliberately not reconciled.
- **Closed:** `[#363]` (superseded by `[#469]`), `[#394]`, `[#432]` (ADR-106; clean-checkout
  `uv sync --locked` run as its done-when required).
- **Narrowed:** `[#338]` → legs (b)–(e); `[#317]` → leg (a).
- **Annotated, still OPEN:** `[#146]` (clause (a) landed, authorship unverified), `[#296]`.
- **Re-scoped:** `[#487]` — pipeline-repair-first, four ordered legs, L, not first batch.
- **Born:** `[#501]` `[#502]` `[#503]` `[#504]`. **B3 (vale) born zero rows** — refuted.
- `[S24]`'s completed-story disposition was **verified as already landed** (`3c050b15`), not
  re-done. `[#170]` untouched. Everything else cold and live-pegged.
<!-- FILL-IN:shipped END -->

## §4 — Next-frontier decisions (the design "why" that travels)

<!-- FILL-IN:frontier START (hand-authored — the open architecture questions + decision context the next session must resume rather than rediscover; the residual's core payload in architect mode) -->
**1. `[#501]`'s path is sanctioned but the directory does not exist, and that was deliberate.**
The operator approved `.github/workflows/` as a *path in the row*, explicitly creating nothing
this window, so **zero coupled gates have fired yet**. At BUILD they will: hermetization sanction
(ADR-101 closed sets), the parity root row, the derived-tree prose-edge exclusion, doc-counts
regen, and the codemap check — roughly five, and the standing precedent is to conform them **by
precedent, in the same commit**, never by dispositions. The open question is whether that
conformance rides `[#501]`'s build commit or is split; splitting it means main briefly carries an
unsanctioned tree.

**2. The tier answer forecloses a plan people will otherwise keep making.** The account is
**Free** and the repo stays **private** by standing ruling (employer material), so `[#501]` has
**no promote-to-gate path** — it is a report-only recorder indefinitely, and **the ADR-at-arming
has no live trigger until the tier changes**. This is written into the row precisely so nobody
drafts that ADR early. The value is real and narrow: a server-side record no `--no-verify` can
erase. Revisit only if the tier changes.

**3. `[#502]` is structurally blocked on `[#501]`, not merely sequenced after it.** mutmut needs
`fork()`; Windows-native is out; WSL is out by operator constraint; so CI is the only host and
the wall must exist first. The dependency edge is written into both row bodies. One empirical
unknown survives deliberately: **`mutmut` under `uv run --locked` is NOT VERIFIED** — settle it
by running the pilot, not by more reading.

**4. `[#504]` owes a terra review before merge, and carries a trap in its own body.** The
`:153`/`:169` fail-soft descriptions in `block_ff_push.py` are **correct** and are not to be
"fixed" — only the module-level posture claim at `:39` (and `ARCHITECTURE.md:327`) contradicts
the ADR-85 §A6 fail-closed flip. `[#501]` and `[#504]` share `serialize-group: architecture`
because both touch `ARCHITECTURE.md`; run them serially, never concurrently on that file.

**5. Three V-1 doctrine lessons are owed into `STANDING_RULINGS.md` next window**, along with the
**B2 label update** (today's register edit was held to A2 by ruling): (i) the exact `uv` pin is
load-bearing for the *entire* organ mesh — the mesh is wrapped in `uv run --locked`, and an
unpinned environment silently loses both the commit gates and the `Stop` hook, which has **two
distinct silences and only one means "fine"**; (ii) mid-flight corrections to a probe lane are
indistinguishable from injection — load-bearing content belongs in the lane's *original*
contract; (iii) **no read of `origin/*` is evidence about the remote without a fetch first** —
the night session reasoned about exactly this risk and still got it wrong, calling
`git ls-tree origin/main` "ancestry-free" when it reads a *local* tracking ref.

**6. `[#499]`'s flip evidence chain has STARTED and can be broken by silence.** This window is
seal #1 with a false-positive count of **zero** on local gates. The bar is zero across **two
consecutive** seals, and nothing mechanically enforces the reporting — a seal that omits the
count does not merely fail to advance the chain, it breaks it. The next seal owes the count
explicitly. Related: the cloud's `canonical_freshness` FAILs were **shallow-clone environment
artifacts**, not false positives of this leg, and must not be counted against it.

**7. The `[#296]` finding generalizes, and that is the part worth keeping.** `audit.py repo
--repo-path` does write its report — to the `automation/fleet-audit` replication branch — so the
path it prints resolves to nothing in the working tree. The class is **"the artifact exists, the
locator lies"**, which no gate catches because nothing is missing. Worth asking whether other
ADR-80 replication paths print working-tree locators for branch-resident artifacts.

**8. `[#487]` stays L and out of the first batch.** Its re-scope inverted the order for a reason:
adjudicating 149 parked proposals produced by a defective pipeline just re-parks them. Legs (i)
and (ii) share one root cause — nothing writes `- [x]`, so an unchecked-still-open id pins
`since_commit` open forever. Repair before consumption.

## §6 — Task-state (pointer, not narration)

The **BACKLOG is the spec; items are tickets.** Task-state is: a pointer to `BACKLOG.md`, the live
in-progress branches (`git branch -v`), and any **drift-flag** `validate_git_backlog` raises (§1 /
`PROBES.md` P4). Re-narrating item text splits the truth and drifts — the pointer + the drift-flag is
the whole task-state.

# Probe manifest — architect mode: orientation first, then teeth (HANDOFF_PROCESS §5 + §13c)
<!-- scope: meta -->

> **Contract.** Each probe ships a **question + source-locator + verification command** and **no

> command against **live state at check-time** via `/handoff-verify`, re-derives ground truth, and
> emits **one evidence block** carrying each row's PASS/FAIL and live evidence. The operator pastes
> that block once (HANDOFF_PROCESS §5 — the v6 one-round-trip boot). **Any FAIL blocks onboarding**,
> and a missing required row is not a pass. Degrade loudly: a moved anchor → WARN `anchor-missing`, re-anchor (never a synthesized

## P0 — Standing-topic reconciliation (emitted **above** P1 — A7 / R2)

The **standing authorities** a session reconciles against before it plans: the live epic
themes and the live accepted intakes. This was a §13 prose rule and it failed three consecutive
windows — *a rule with no probe has no teeth* — so it is mechanized here. **Deterministic legs
only** (the RM-4 / S3d boundedness law): there is no open-ended adjudication leg, because
whole-set grooming is an **arc, not a probe** (JOURNAL 2026-07-26 (h)). P0c is narrowed to a
**name-match** for exactly that reason (amendment A2): "does the Purpose *serve* this authority"
is a judgment a probe cannot terminate on, and a leg that cannot fail honestly discredits the
block. Same contract as every row below: question + source-locator + command, **no answer**.

| # | Probe (question) | Binds to (primary source) | Why a summary can't answer it | CC verifies via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0a | Quote, **substring-exact**, the theme-preamble line of each **active** `[E#]` epic theme in `BACKLOG.md` — **and** separately confirm the generated backlog is **CURRENT**, not stale. | `BACKLOG.md` `[E#]` theme headers + the preamble line under each | the preamble set drifts on any theme edit, and `BACKLOG.md` is GENERATED since [#436] — a probe that can pass on stale generated content is bluffable, so currency is asserted mechanically, not assumed | `grep -A1 '^## \[E' BACKLOG.md` → each quote substring-matches the live preamble (a paraphrase is a FAIL); **then** `python scripts/gen_task_tree.py --check` exits 0 — a non-zero exit is a FAIL (currency — R2's second assertion) |
| P0b | Enumerate, live, every doc under `docs/intake/` whose frontmatter carries `status: ACCEPTED`, and quote each one's **TITLE line** (its first level-1 `#`-heading). **Titles only.** | `docs/intake/*.md` frontmatter + first heading; area definition at `docs/intake/README.md` | the accepted set and its titles drift on any intake status change; neither the set nor any title appears in this bundle | `grep -l '^status: ACCEPTED' docs/intake/*.md` then read each hit's first heading line |
| P0c | Does **this bundle's own Purpose** NAME at least one authority present in the P0a/P0b enumeration? **No match = FAIL**, route to the escalation ladder. (Whether the Purpose genuinely *serves* that authority is an architect judgment, deliberately outside the mechanical check — amendment A2.) | this bundle's `docs/handoffs/2026-08-06-dev-knowledge-architect/HANDOFF_BOOT.md` Purpose ∩ the live P0a/P0b output | the Purpose is hand-authored per bundle and the authorities are live, so the name-match is computable only after P0a and P0b have both been run | `sed -n '/FILL-IN:purpose/,+1p' docs/handoffs/2026-08-06-dev-knowledge-architect/HANDOFF_BOOT.md` → check it names an authority the P0a/P0b output enumerates; no match = FAIL |

**Honest narrowing (terra H3).** P0b quotes **titles**, not wave/sequence detail: wave content is
unstructured prose today, so quoting it would overclaim determinism (the RM-4 law applied to this
row's own design). Wave-level teeth require the intake schema to first gain a required,
machine-locatable plan-of-record heading — an intake-schema change owned by `docs/intake/README.md`,
offered as an option, not assumed.

## P1 — Orientation (the architect's **first move**, before any mechanism — §13c)

A plain-language "what is this project" is **summary-bluffable** and so fails §5's own bar; a copy of
VISION into the handoff is barred (§2/§3). So orientation is a **forced exact-line read**: the line
enters the session **only** by CC reading the **live** primary source, and the quote must match as a
**substring** (never a paraphrase). The browser has no files, so CC reads live and substring-checks,
and the result arrives in the evidence block. The grep is a **tool** that confirms the frame — **the
backlog navigates** (§13c), not this read.

| # | Probe (question) | Binds to (primary source) | Why a summary can't answer it | CC verifies via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1a | Quote, **substring-exact**, the **opening sentence** of `VISION.md` `## Vision` — *what .dev-knowledge is*. | `VISION.md` `## Vision` | a paraphrase of "what this is" is not a substring; a summary rounds it off | `grep -A4 '^## Vision' VISION.md` → the quote must be a substring of the live section |
| P1b | Quote, **substring-exact**, the **opening line** of `ARCHITECTURE.md` Ch1 (`## Purpose [CORE]`) — *where this work sits*. | `ARCHITECTURE.md` `## Purpose [CORE]` | the orienting line is in the live file only; a summary holds a gist, not the substring | `sed -n '/^## Purpose \[CORE\]/,+5p' ARCHITECTURE.md` → the quote must be a substring of the live section |

**Gate:** the architect may not proceed to design until it **holds both orienting lines** — read live
by CC, substring-matched. **Then, before design, the operator-context beat fires (§13d):** the browser
asks the operator for **off-repo** context.
The operator has **filled** the supplement, so its ANSWERS are in the paste and the beat **NARROWS** to *"anything changed since the supplement was written?"*.

## Teeth probes (state fidelity — same contract; **answers deliberately withheld, §5**)

| # | Probe (question) | Binds to (primary source) | Why a summary can't answer it | CC verifies via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2 | How many checks are in `ALL_CHECKS`, and what is the registry **name** of the final (last) one? | `ALL_CHECKS` in `scripts/audit.py` | the count + last name drift every time a check lands; a summary rounds/omits both | `python scripts/audit.py checks` (set `PYTHONUTF8=1` on a bare PowerShell console — see the cp1252 note) |
| P3 | What is the current **short HEAD sha**, is the working tree clean, which **branch** is checked out, how many commits is `main` **ahead of / behind** `origin/main` — and does that live branch **match the `Destination` row's branch field** in this bundle's boot header? A mismatch is a **FAIL**: the lane is not where the handoff sent it. | live git ∩ the **Destination** row of `docs/handoffs/2026-08-06-dev-knowledge-architect/HANDOFF_BOOT.md` | the summary holds the generation-time state; this handoff's own commit + the later `/ship` merge move HEAD and push `main` ahead until pushed. The `Destination` branch is declared **ex-ante** at generation while the live branch is read at check-time, so whether they agree is computable only now | `git rev-parse --short HEAD` then `git status -sb` then `git branch --show-current` then `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...main` (the last is REQUIRED: `git status -sb` reports the CHECKED-OUT branch's upstream, not `main` vs `origin/main`, and prints no divergence at all when the branch has no upstream), then compare the live branch against the **Destination** row of `docs/handoffs/2026-08-06-dev-knowledge-architect/HANDOFF_BOOT.md` — mismatch = FAIL |
| P4 | Which backlog `#id`(s) does `validate_git_backlog` flag **right now**, and what is the **full short-sha** (as the validator prints it) of the closing merge for each? | live git ∩ `BACKLOG.md` | the drifted set is computed at answer-time; the sha is high-entropy, documented nowhere in the bundle | `python scripts/validate_git_backlog.py` |
| P5 | Is `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s `last_reviewed` stamp **on/after or before** its last git-commit touch — and what are the **two dates**? | `ARCHITECTURE.md` frontmatter + live git | a *relation* over commits; a summary holds neither date precisely | `git log -1 --format=%cs -- ARCHITECTURE.md` vs the frontmatter stamp |
| P6 | What does `validate_doc_claims` report for **`pytest_collected`** — the doc-claim integer, the live-collected integer, and **do they match**? The claim lives in `ecosystem/doc-counts.md`, **not** `ARCHITECTURE.md` (decoupled by #222). | `ecosystem/doc-counts.md` (`doc=` target) + live pytest | the live count drifts on any test change; neither integer appears in this bundle | `python scripts/validate_doc_claims.py` (the `pytest_collected` line) |
| P7 | Does `audit.py ship-gate` come back **GREEN or RED** right now, **how many WARNs are dispositioned**, and **is there a `[stale]` disposition**? | live git ∩ `main` history ∩ `ecosystem/disposition-register.yaml` | **THIS is the §1 headline** — the GREEN/RED verdict, the dispositioned-WARN count, and any `[stale]` line are computed at answer-time over live git ∩ `main`; a new direct-on-`main` commit re-REDs it; the values are absent from the bundle | `python scripts/audit.py ship-gate` (read the final GREEN/RED verdict + the disposition count + any `[stale]` line) — re-derive; do **not** trust the residual's prose |
| P8 | How many files does a **v5 architect bundle** carry, does it include a **per-bundle `README.md`**, is `SUPPLEMENT.md` present, **is its ANSWERS region empty or filled**, and where does the stable operator boilerplate live instead? | `docs/handoffs/2026-08-06-dev-knowledge-architect/` listing ∩ `HANDOFF_PROCESS.md` §13 | a summary may "remember" a stale file count or the wrong supplement fill-state; the live bundle + spec are the only ground truth | `ls docs/handoffs/2026-08-06-dev-knowledge-architect/` ∩ `grep -A3 'PASTE CHAT ANSWERS' docs/handoffs/2026-08-06-dev-knowledge-architect/SUPPLEMENT.md` (is there substantive text below the divider?) |
| P9 | How many **serialize-groups** does `validate_backlog` summarize **right now**, which `#id`(s) are in the **code-edge** group, and which `#id`s are in the **coherence** group? | `BACKLOG.md` ∩ `scripts/validate_backlog.py` | group membership is a live schema fact that drifts on any BACKLOG edit; it is absent from this bundle | `python scripts/validate_backlog.py` (the serialize-groups summary line) |
| P10 | **BACKLOG grooming (operator ruling 2026-07-17).** For **every OPEN item** in `BACKLOG.md`, is each still **live** (actively in-progress), **dead** (superseded / obsoleted / already-shipped — a grooming close per ADR-65), or **awaiting-ruling** (blocked on an operator / Council decision)? The successor grooms the **whole open set** at boot — no open `#id` may pass unreconciled. | `BACKLOG.md` ∩ `scripts/validate_backlog.py` ∩ live git | the live / dead / awaiting-ruling status of each open item is an at-boot judgment over current git ∩ `BACKLOG.md`; a summary holds a stale snapshot and cannot tell a still-live item from one the fleet already shipped or superseded | `python scripts/validate_backlog.py` (schema + serialize-groups) then `git log --first-parent --oneline main` to cross-check each open `#id` against its closing merge |

## Gate procedure (CC)

1. **Run the whole gate in one pass** (`/handoff-verify`), in table order: **P0 first, then P1**,
   then the remaining rows — every row against **live state now**. Table order IS the execution order. The
   architect cannot begin design until both orienting lines are read live and substring-matched.
   **The operator-context beat (§13d) fires after the block is in hand.**
2. For each, record **PASS** (live ground truth obtained and consistent) or **FAIL** (anchor missing /
   command errored / receiver tried to answer from memory or this bundle).
3. **Any FAIL → ABORT onboarding** and route through the escalation ladder (re-read the named primary
   source → CC re-derives the fact → abort if still unmet).
4. Probes P0a–P10 are *designed to move* between generation and check-time — that is the point. **Answer
   values are deliberately absent (§5)**: the pass criterion is **"answered from the live source,"**
   never "matches a remembered number." P7 is the headline (GREEN/RED + dispositioned-WARN count +
   any `[stale]` line). P8 pins the bundle shape **and the live supplement fill-state**. P10 grooms the
   whole open BACKLOG at boot (live / dead / awaiting-ruling per open `#id`). First check
   which branch is live (P3), then re-derive every load-bearing fact from the live primary source.

Q1. STRATEGIC INTENT: Stop preparing parallelism — exercise it. The next
session's way-of-working goal is to run batch 1 (3 lanes + integrator) as a
MACHINERY DRILL and prove the V-1 shape end-to-end (worktree lanes, frozen
contracts, per-lane V-2 budgets, single serial integrator, exactly 2
operator touches), then go wide in batch 2 (pre-named, R-i: 5-8 lanes —
#25 W-wave · [#487] repaired-pipeline legs · [#490] North-Star entry).
"Three windows of hub introspection spent" is a commitment, not a mood.

Q2. TENSIONS WEIGHED: (a) narrow-vs-wide batch 1 — staging won (3 lanes
drill the machinery; width without a proven integrator is risk, not speed).
(b) ADR-now vs ADR-at-arming for server-side enforcement — arming-moment
won; tier=Free then removed arming's live trigger entirely. (c) [#487]
engine-vs-judgment — judgment + pipeline-repair won on evidence (0 confirms
/62 files/2 months). (d) process-production vs shipping — register+template
landed but Finding-1 proved the cost of touching doctrine surfaces without
the coupled updates; the introspection budget is declared SPENT. (e) UI
cockpit vs contract discipline — VS Code Agents window adopted as cockpit,
ruled NEVER load-bearing (lane discipline comes from contract + gates).

Q3. CONSIDERED + REJECTED: vale as ratchet host (measured refutation:
per-block counting, closed scripting hatch — 441 stays bespoke) · P2 as its
own row (folded into [#493]) · equalizing the ~10 work-lane ceiling with
the 2-3 epic-lane cap (different axes, now cross-pointed) · name-match
closes ([#170] defense) · ceiling-change as the prose-orphan fix (rejected
in R-C; diagnosis-home standard adopted instead) · origin/* reads without
fetch as remote evidence (V-1 lesson iii) · root AGENTS.md without
codex/AGENTS.md reconciliation · WSL for mutmut (operator: CI-only) ·
public repos for CI minutes (standing, employer material).

Q4. OPEN QUESTIONS: [#408] per-section granularity values (pre-chewed in
the night design draft; operator decision) · [#487] repair-leg sequencing
inside batch 2 · [E8] ARC-5 has NO completion record — silently stopped or
unrecorded? · DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md is outside the freshness-gated set ·
W-6 schema-as-code placement · STANDING_RULINGS B2 label + three V-1
doctrine lessons (uv-pin load-bearing; mid-flight lane corrections =
untrusted; fetch-before-remote-evidence) — OWED next window · assisted-
approvals posture after batch-1 experience.

Q5. DECOMPOSITION RATIONALE: batch 1 is cut by FILE-OWNERSHIP
footprint-disjointness with the one shared file (ARCHITECTURE.md) held out
of all lanes and carried by the integrator; [#502] rides as [#501]'s
dependency-chained tail (CI-only ruling). Do NOT redo or re-decide:
R-A/R-B/R-C/R-D rulings and their red-team amendments · the batch-1 cut
(operator GO + predecessor approve on record) · grooming verdicts · the
four births' scope and footprints · B3's refutation.

Q6. OFF-REPO CONTEXT: GitHub tier = Free (checked in Billing) → [#501] is
report-only recorder indefinitely; WSL excluded by operator; VS Code
1.129/1.130 cockpit research done (Agents window, agent host, New Worktree
checkbox) with a pre-batch-1 checklist — enablement is being executed in a
parallel terminal THIS session so the successor boots into a ready cockpit;
operator's Downloads carry: SESSION-PLAN (v2, §A-§J), VSCODE-PARALLEL-
COCKPIT, SUPPLEMENT-ANSWERS-C1-C8 (predecessor riders folded in header).

Q7. RATIFIED-IN-CHAT REGISTER (not yet in repo): "batch-1 cut as named +
GO" — 3 lanes + integrator holding ARCHITECTURE.md; home: this supplement +
successor bundle intent · "riders R-i/R-ii/R-iii" — batch-2 pre-named,
W-5 placed-not-deferred, supplement-commits-clean; home: this supplement ·
"cockpit adopted, never load-bearing" — VS Code Agents window is optional
sugar on unchanged mechanics; home: LESSONS one-liner or next window's
STANDING_RULINGS pass · "introspection budget spent" — hub-only windows end
here; home: successor bundle Purpose. The three V-1 lessons + B2 label are
already listed in Q4 with their durable home (STANDING_RULINGS, next
window). Everything else ratified this window is already ON the spine
(A2 rule 042ef33b · JOURNAL-rides-the-branch mechanism in seal 616f4814 ·
scope-split precedence adf85c4a).

ADDENDUM (post-enablement, binding successor intents):
· Fourth V-1 lesson: bare pytest in a worktree lane inherits VIRTUAL_ENV
  from the primary tree and tests the WRONG environment — `uv run --locked`
  is mandatory per lane (joins the three lessons for the STANDING_RULINGS
  pass).
· Parallel-management architecture RULED this window (do not relitigate):
  Track 1 (batch 1) = CC-native primitives (`claude --worktree`, agent
  view / `claude agents`) + the batch protocol REPO-ENCODED as versioned
  artifacts (PLAYBOOK §, project-scoped .claude/commands/, handoff-bundle
  pointer) so no seat depends on memory — authoring that protocol is the
  successor's task, [#429] slim scope (adopt-native + hygiene-organ WARN +
  lane/ branch-prefix enum). Track 2 (batch 2, multi-provider) = 30-min
  eval of Vibe Kanban WITH its official VS Code extension
  (bloop.vibe-kanban), PASS criteria pre-named: in-IDE tasks/logs/diffs ·
  full lifecycle incl. worktree CLEANUP verified · second provider (Codex)
  on one card · headless server as a VS Code task; version pinned in
  win-tooling config-as-code; sunset-to-community risk accepted because
  lock-in is zero. Rejected with reasons: hand-rolled /batch-* (native
  /batch exists), web-UI-outside-VS-Code as primary surface, tmux (WSL),
  Copilot-gated Agents window. herdr on the watch-list (terminal
  multiplexer candidate if the native board stops sufficing).
