# HANDOFF — corp-sca-time-automation

> **Provenance:** Migrated from `corp-sca-time-automation/docs/handoffs/2026-04-15-handoff.md` during the 2026-05-27 taxonomy-simplification session (ADR-60 amendment: `handoffs/` centralizes in `.dev-knowledge`; child code repos do not carry `handoffs/`). This is a pre-2026-04-27 legacy single-file handoff (BACKLOG documents this pattern as still acceptable for pre-folder-format artifacts).

**Date:** 2026-04-15
**Verified against:** `git log --oneline -20` on 2026-04-17
**Project Scale:** M
**Branch at handoff:** `feat/gap-filler-v2` (since merged to `main`)

---

## OBJECTIVE

Full architecture review of corp-sca-time-automation, followed by implementation of three major features (catchup mode, Excel SUM formulas, gap filler v2) and resolution of issues discovered during manual testing.

---

## STATUS

All three features merged to `main`. Pipeline works end-to-end: `python run.py catchup` queries SharePoint for last uploaded week, calculates missing weeks, attempts VBS calendar export, runs AI-enabled pipeline with weighted-blend gap filler, generates Excel with SUM formulas, opens preview. Remaining open item: `last_sunday()` edge case when today is Sunday.

---

## COMPLETED

### Architecture Review
Seven findings identified and prioritized:
- **P0:** Upload idempotency (duplicate entries risk) → ✅ Implemented
- **P1:** Token management via AzureCliCredential → ✅ Implemented (fallback chain)
- **P2:** Test coverage for overlap + gap filler → ✅ Covered (70 tests total)
- Lower priority: VBS replacement, synthetic comment tagging, aggregator.py rename, config path hardcoding — moved to backlog

### Features Implemented

| Feature | Branch | Tests Added | Status |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Catchup mode + upload idempotency | `feat/catchup-mode` → main | 38 (15 date_utils + 11 sharepoint + 7 catchup + 5 idempotency) | ✅ Merged |
| Excel SUM formulas | `feat/excel-sum-formulas` → main | 4 | ✅ Merged |
| Gap filler v2 + Gemini update | `feat/gap-filler-v2` → main | 11 | ✅ Merged |

### Incremental Fixes (all merged to main)
- Auth fallback chain: `GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN` env → `.env` file → `az` subprocess → SystemExit
- `azure-identity` removed, `shell=True` added to `az` subprocess (Windows `.cmd` wrapper)
- Progress prints at each pipeline stage in `catchup` and `preview` commands
- PermissionError fail-fast: checks Excel file writability BEFORE running 20-min pipeline
- VBS timeout UX: on timeout prompts "Retry? [y/N]" then "Continue with existing JSON? [y/N]"
- VBS debug logging: `WScript.Echo` progress lines added to `calendar_export.vbs`
- `PROJECT_CODES_EXCEL` env var wired into config loader (overrides `paths.project_codes`)
- `os.startfile` auto-opens Excel after both `preview` and `catchup`
- Post-run hint: prints `Next: python run.py upload --all` at end of both commands
- README updated (catchup, --force, test count, gap filler v2 description)
- VBS export auto-triggered in `catchup` via `subprocess.run` with `weeks_back_to_cover()`
- 14 additional VBS export tests added (now **70 total**, up from 56)

### Claude Code Prompts Delivered
1. `sca-time-catchup-prompt.md` — catchup mode + upload idempotency (6 steps)
2. `sca-time-excel-formulas-prompt.md` — Excel SUM formulas (5 steps, playbook-compliant v2)
3. `sca-time-gap-filler-v2-prompt.md` — weighted blend + Gemini fallback (9 steps)

### Playbook Compliance Issue
First two prompts did not fully follow Dev Practice Playbook. Missing: gotchas read, `pytest -x --tb=short` after every step, `git status` clean checks, test stubs before implementation, JOURNAL.md entry. Called out by user — corrected in Excel SUM prompt v2 and gap filler prompt. Memory updated to enforce playbook in all future prompts.

## PENDING

### Still Open
- **`last_sunday()` edge case** — if today IS Sunday, `last_sunday()` returns today (current week in progress), which should be excluded from catchup range. Currently `(ref.weekday() + 1) % 7` returns 0 when weekday==6, so ref is returned unchanged. Fix: subtract 7 if result == ref and ref.weekday() == 6.

### Backlog (separate sessions)
- **VBS → Graph API calendar read** — highest-priority architectural improvement. VBS/COM is unreliable: IT blocks Programmatic Access (Trust Center greyed out), requires Outlook running, intermittent hangs with no error. Graph API calendar read uses same token as SharePoint, eliminates COM dependency entirely.
- **MSAL app registration** — eliminate manual Graph Explorer token paste. Requires Azure AD app registration in BY tenant (may need IT approval). Currently `az` token has SharePoint read 403 — only Graph Explorer token works for both read and write.
- **`aggregator.py` rename** — misleading name ("no aggregation of events"), consider `week_builder.py`
- **Monorepo merge** — reconcile namespace, paths, `PROJECT_CODES_EXCEL` resolution
- **Synthetic comment tagging** — autofilled entries should be subtly marked as generated (compliance risk if audited)
- **Local branch cleanup** — `feat/excel-sum-formulas` branch still exists locally, not deleted

---

## KEY DECISIONS

- **Gap filler algorithm:** Weighted blend — 50% current week + 50% 4-week sliding window historical profile. Gemini JSON fallback when both profiles empty/sparse. Equal distribution as final hard fallback. Never asks user anything.
- **Never-autofill enforcement:** Three layers — `build_historical_profile` strips restricted categories, `allocate_gap_hours` never receives them, `ask_gemini_allocation` validates response and strips if Gemini returns them anyway.
- **Auth fallback chain:** `GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN` env var → `.env` file in repo root → `az account get-access-token` subprocess (shell=True) → SystemExit. `azure-identity` package removed.
- **`az` token vs Graph Explorer token:** `az` token returns 403 on SharePoint list GET (lacks `Sites.Read.All` scope). Graph Explorer token works for both read (GET) and write (POST). Manual paste into `.env` is current workflow.
- **Excel SUM formulas:** Replacement at openpyxl write layer ONLY. DataFrame retains static float values for other consumers (status command, catchup summary print).
- **Playbook enforcement:** Every Claude Code prompt must include: read gotchas, `pytest -x --tb=short` + `ruff check` + `git status` after every step, test stubs before implementation, JOURNAL.md 3-line entry. Saved to memory.
- **Config in settings.yaml:** `gap_filler.current_weight: 0.5`, `gap_filler.history_window: 4` — no magic numbers in code.

## CONTEXT

- **70 tests** (was 56 at handoff write time; 14 VBS export tests added in subsequent commits)
- **Gemini model** updated from `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` to latest stable Flash (verify actual string in `settings.yaml`)
- **VBS COM access** intermittently blocked by IT group policy. Trust Center → Programmatic Access greyed out. `Get-Process OUTLOOK` confirms single process running. Sometimes works (222 events exported), sometimes hangs indefinitely after "Weeks back: 9". Root cause: IT policy, not code. Only fix is architecture change (Graph API calendar).
- **SharePoint confirmed working:** site_id `jda365.sharepoint.com,05bdc0c0...`, list_id `70738fad...`. GET with Graph Explorer token returns items. POST for uploads works. `get_last_uploaded_week()` returns `2026-02-01`. 8 weeks missing (Feb 8 → Mar 29).
- **New env var:** `PROJECT_CODES_EXCEL` — wired into config loader as override for `paths.project_codes`
- **`/clear` before next session** — different feature scope
