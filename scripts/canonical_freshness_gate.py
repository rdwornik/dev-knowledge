"""Canonical living-file freshness gate — the portable (Group A) enforcement organ.

Single-sourced from what used to live inline in `scripts/audit.py::check_canonical_freshness`,
so ONE module serves both:
  - the hub **audit leg** — `audit.py` imports `evaluate` + the helpers and wraps the result in
    its `Finding` envelope (leg behaviour unchanged); and
  - a **consumer-local pre-commit gate** — this module's `__main__` runs against the consumer
    root and exits 1 on a FAIL (blocks the commit), 0 otherwise.

Deployed into a consumer verbatim by the enforcement-mesh carrier (Fable-consult mesh, #236);
its `canonical_freshness` name/path is exactly what the Informant's `locate` scans for.

A2 (FAIL): `last_reviewed` predates the file's last git-commit date (edited but not re-reviewed).
A1 (WARN): `last_reviewed` older than the calendar cadence (a loose nudge even when unchanged).
Missing `last_reviewed` -> WARN (child-repo-safe: adopt the convention without a hard failure).
A2 is COMMIT-based (not working-tree): an uncommitted edit is not flagged until it lands, so a
mid-edit tree does not FAIL before the reviewer bumps the stamp. Read-only; degrades gracefully
without git (A2 skipped). JOURNAL/LESSONS + the per-session BACKLOG are deliberately EXCLUDED
from the default set (their freshness is intrinsic to how they are written).
