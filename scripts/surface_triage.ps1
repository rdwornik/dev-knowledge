# SessionStart surfacing for the nightly conformance loop (Phase C4 / ADR-68).
#
# Mirrors the L0 surface-closures.ps1 pattern: READ-ONLY, fail-soft, ALWAYS exit 0,
# silent on the happy path (gh absent / unauthenticated / offline, or nothing to
# report). Surfaces three things, each only when there is something to say:
#   [triage]  — open `nightly-triage` Issues await review
#   [nightly] — the last Nightly Conformance Triage Action run did NOT succeed
#   [nightly] — the expected dated digest is missing from the default branch
#               (the no-retry silent-skip class — side-effect check per ADR-68)
# This is a surfacing nudge only — it never blocks or noises the session.
#
# verify: under Windows PowerShell 5.1 (`powershell -File scripts/surface_triage.ps1`,
#   the hook's actual runtime) with zero open `nightly-triage` Issues it prints NO
#   "[triage]" line (not "[triage] 1 ... await: #"); with N open it prints
#   "[triage] N nightly finding(s) await: #a, #b ...". It emits a "[nightly]" line
#   ONLY when the last Action run failed or the expected dated digest is missing
#   from the default branch; on the all-green happy path it prints nothing, exit 0.
