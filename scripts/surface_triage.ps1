# SessionStart surfacing for the nightly conformance loop (Phase C4 / ADR-68).
#
# Mirrors the L0 surface-closures.ps1 pattern: READ-ONLY, fail-soft, ALWAYS exit 0,
# silent on the happy path (gh absent / offline, or nothing to report). Surfaces
# four things, each only when there is something to say:
#   [gh]      — gh auth is invalid/expired (operator-recoverable ONLY; surfaces the
#               refresh command, then skips the gh-dependent checks below)
#   [triage]  — open `nightly-triage` Issues await review
#   [nightly] — the last Nightly Conformance Triage Action run did NOT succeed
#   [nightly] — the expected dated digest is missing from the default branch
#               (the no-retry silent-skip class — side-effect check per ADR-68)
# This is a surfacing nudge only — it never blocks or noises the session.
#
# verify: under Windows PowerShell 5.1 (`powershell -File scripts/surface_triage.ps1`,
#   the hook's actual runtime) with zero open `nightly-triage` Issues it prints NO
#   "[triage]" line (not "[triage] 1 ... await: #"); with N open it prints
#   "[triage] N nightly finding(s) await: #a, #b ...". It emits a "[nightly]" line
#   ONLY when the last Action run failed or the expected dated digest is missing
#   from the default branch; on the all-green happy path it prints nothing, exit 0.
#   With an invalid/expired gh token (`gh auth status` exits non-zero) it prints
#   exactly "[gh] auth invalid -- run: gh auth refresh -h github.com" and skips the
#   gh-dependent checks (exit 0) -- it does NOT fall through to a false all-clear.

    # --- Leading gate: gh auth must be valid ---------------------------------
    # gh auth failures are operator-recoverable ONLY -- the device/OAuth flow
    # needs a human, so a session can never fix an expired/invalid token by
    # retrying. Surface the exact recovery command and skip every gh-dependent
    # check below (fail-soft, exit 0). `gh auth status` exits non-zero when no
    # host is authenticated or the token is invalid/expired. Do NOT swallow it
    # as a silent no-op -- that masks a skipped nightly behind a false all-clear.

        #      the whole array as ONE item and miscounts N issues as 1.
        # Fix for both: ASSIGN the parse to a variable first (it becomes Object[]),
        # THEN filter that array element-wise, keeping only real entries (.number
