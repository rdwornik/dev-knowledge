# LANE b — queue-runner witness contract

| Model | Mode | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| sonnet | execute | high |

**Starts after `a` is merged.**

## Dispatch

**Shape:** `local` — a background lane on the operator's machine, own worktree, commit-and-STOP.

**Kind:** `code` — changes executable code — `scripts/`, `tests/`, hooks, schema, generators.

The kind is DECLARED, not inferred, and it is what the routing default keys on
(`[#885]` clause 2). A text-only, deletion or read-only-digest lane never starts on
Opus; a review lane is not dispatched from a lane contract at all, because
`ecosystem/routing-table.yaml` is the authority for which CLI runs that role; a code lane
plans on Opus and implements on Sonnet **as two sessions with a file between them**,
never as one session changing tier mid-flight. The prompt cache is keyed PER MODEL,
so a mid-session switch re-writes the whole context: at this repo's measured mean of
232,875 tokens per call, one switch costs USD 1.46 into Opus or USD 0.58 into Sonnet
against USD 0.0812 saved per turn moved — about 25 consecutive cheap turns to repay
one round trip. Anything shaped like plan-then-execute is TWO SESSIONS.

```
claude --bg --model sonnet --effort high --permission-mode bypassPermissions --worktree b "Read and execute the frozen contract at $env:CLAUDE_PROMPTS_DIR\LANE-b.md"
```

**The operator does NOT type the line above.** He types
`dispatch LANE-b.md` **from the target repo root** — the hub shim over
`scripts/dispatch.py launch`, which runs the hub's launcher without changing
directory (PLAYBOOK Ch8's dispatch table, the sole literal-command site). From
the hub checkout itself, `uv run --locked python scripts/dispatch.py launch LANE-b.md`
is the same act typed in full. The launcher reads this `## Dispatch`
block for its fields — model, effort, worktree, permission mode — and builds the
session's own argv; it never runs the block. The `$env:CLAUDE_PROMPTS_DIR`
token is how a frozen contract names its own location without hard-coding an
absolute path. The repo root still matters: the worktree
is created relative to the current repo, so dispatching from the wrong one
lands the lane in it.

The line carries every dispatch constant rather than defaulting it:
`--permission-mode bypassPermissions` (a `--bg` lane has nobody to answer a
permission prompt, so a default would stall it silently), `--bg`,
and `--worktree b` — the name that produces `worktree-b` and with it
the ADR-110 pairing and the merge exemption. Board label `[.dev-knowledge · #1633 · b]`.
**The model is ON the line, not defaulted** (`[#717]`): it is rendered from the
routing table above, so this lane dispatches at `sonnet` whatever any
surface default (`opus`, the `.dev-knowledge` default per the Ch8
routing matrix) happens to be. A line that omitted it would silently re-decide
the most expensive constant on it. Effort is a closed enum:
{low | medium | high | xhigh | max}; a value outside it is refused with the enum named,
rather than guessed.

**The `claude` head token is required, not stylistic** (`[#675]` clause 1 /
AX25-2). The launcher admits a `claude`, `codex` or `copilot` head and refuses
any other program, so a contract's `## Dispatch` block is not a place to name a
helper. Until 2026-09-12 this generator emitted a different head here and
**every contract it produced was refused by the reader meant to launch it**;
`tests/test_dispatch_conformance.py` is the standing witness that the fence this
generator writes is one `dispatch.py` accepts. A lane already holding `worktree-b`
is refused earlier and more broadly at STEP 0 by
`seat_refusals lane-ceiling --check-worktrees`, which reads the live worktree
list before the first worktree exists.

## Roles

| Phase | Model | Where |
|---|---|---|
| implement | claude-sonnet-5-5 | codespace |
| lane head | claude-sonnet-5-5 | local |
| RED tests | **Copilot CLI** `gpt-6-luna` | codespace |
| review | gpt-5.6-terra + **Copilot CLI** (default model) | local + codespace |
| isolated verify | claude-sonnet-5-5 | local |

The table is rendered from `ecosystem/provider-registry.yaml` (roles `implement`, `seat-orchestrator`, `red`, `review`, `verify`). The `implement` row reads the registry's first `implement` entry (R11); the pre-launch gate judges the `implement` and `lane head` rows.

## Worktree pairing

slug `b` -> branch `worktree-b` -> contract `LANE-b.md`

One lane = one contract file = one branch, so an open lane resolves to the
contract that created it and an orphan is attributable at a glance (ADR-110,
fifth per-lane requirement). The `worktree-` prefix is applied exactly ONCE — the flag takes the bare lane
name.

## Done-contract (immutable)

1. `<what [#1633] delivers — checkable, not aspirational>`
2. `<the second done-when, or delete this line>`
3. Docs and code in English; hyphen-only names; logging rather than print;
   Click for a CLI where one is warranted; `pytest` green.
4. **Close-out:** the review record carries the served model id from the tool's
   own log and the nonce or content hash the reviewer returned (R59).

## Decision budget

**V-2 — this lane escalates on three classes only.** Everything else is decided per
contract defaults and reported in the end packet rather than asked
(`protocols/STANDING_RULINGS.md` "The decision budget"):

- **(a)** curated-baseline touches
- **(b)** genuine rule-vs-ruling conflicts
- **(c)** fork classes with no standing ruling

A lane that discovers a refuted premise PAUSEs with the fact (Q10):
deviation-with-disclosure is not a license — the disclosure discharges the reporting
duty, it does not authorise the deviation.

## Steps

1. `<imperative — what is done>` **COMMIT**
2. `<imperative>` **COMMIT**
3. Final: `pytest` green, one end-of-lane artifact (what changed · proposed diffs · open items), **COMMIT, then STOP.**

## What NOT to do

- No merges, no pushes to `main`, no touching another lane's branch — commit-and-STOP;
  integration is the integrator's act, from the primary checkout.
- No JOURNAL entry — that is the integrator's surface (`protocols/STANDING_RULINGS.md` P-1).
- No index regeneration — the integrator is gate-of-record and regenerates once
  at the merge (Q1); a lane declares its single-hook bypass in the commit body.
- No edits outside this lane's declared footprint.
