# Journal — .dev-knowledge

<!-- scope: meta -->

> Per-session tactical log of `.dev-knowledge` Claude Code work. Did/Failed/Next
> entry shape per PLAYBOOK Stream B Gap #4 spec, newest-first prepend ordering
> per PLAYBOOK Documentation file types v1.1 amendment (2026-04-27).
>
> Distinct from CHANGELOG (per-commit notable changes), LESSONS (per-learning
> generalized rules, oldest-top per ADR-29), and handoffs (per-session boundary
> artifacts for browser-chat resumption): JOURNAL is the within-Claude-Code-
> sessions tactical log enabling context recovery across sessions in same repo.
>
> Update protocol: prepend new session entry at top of entry list (under this
> intro blockquote, before existing entries). One entry per Claude Code session
> OR per workday for heavy days. Each entry cites commit hashes, handoff doc,
> or ADR for deeper detail. JOURNAL summarizes, doesn't duplicate.

### 2026-04-28 | ADR-31 + ADR-32 formalized

**Did:**
- Drafted ADR-31 (authority model) + ADR-32 (handoff format) from DECISION_28 + DECISION_29 transcripts. 4 commits on feature branch, merged clean. 2 amendments after Rob review (manifest name softened, extract-to-task follow-up pointer added).

**Failed:** —

**Next:** (a2) `protocols/HANDOFF_PROCESS.md` rewrite referencing ADR-32 — own session.

---

### 2026-04-27 | Stream C session 1 bonus scope — audit infrastructure + Path B + Tier 3 Prompt 2 + X1 + JOURNAL backfill

**Did:**
- ESSENTIALS.md 4-commit refactor (C1-C4): structural cleanup (`2bbe340`, `7421d9e`, `957baee`, `66382ca`, `e1c30cf`), skills reference sub-bullet (`2132a77`), Feedback Loop restructured with Auto vs Manual cadence labels (`e6baca9`), new "How Claude thinks" thinking-quality directives section (`ac96b2c`)
- CLAUDE.md stale references update — PLAYBOOK section count, TOKEN-LOG cadence, ESSENTIALS rule, Council #28 added (`fc8d8b5`)
- README.md Current state section updated to reflect post-Stream-B reality (`2de7826`); handoffs clarified as persistent stream-level decision archive (`3997f11`)
- Deep cleansing diagnostic audit created — 18 findings across 7 files (`8c4a10a`, see `docs/audits/2026-04-27-deep-cleansing-diagnostic.md`)
- ENVIRONMENT.md stale "Last updated: 2026-03-29" fixed → 2026-04-27 (`9e166d9`)
- Path B numbers audit + classification (`d52c243`, see `docs/audits/2026-04-27-numbers-audit.md`); 5-tier execution: Tier A removals (`44f795f`), Tier B replacements (`cff571b`), Tier D rationale (`81edce3`), Tier E decisions (`9a700d9`), merged (`9058238`)
- Tier 3 Prompt 2 audit findings fixes — T1 + C2 + anomaly in CLAUDE.md (`0993669`), E2 + E3 in ESSENTIALS (`3cb9f98`), R2 in README (`3adb6b2`), merged (`0d199e3`)
- X1 verification (Outcome C: PLAYBOOK has its own ### Roles at line 1716 in Section 8, partial overlap with ESSENTIALS canonical version) → blockquote cross-ref added to PLAYBOOK (`b17092d`); audit X1 marked PARTIALLY-INVALID/RESOLVED (`586e360`)
- PLAYBOOK Documentation file types v1.1 — JOURNAL ordering flipped oldest-top → newest-first prepend per Rob's preference (`167c11b`); aligns with TOKEN-LOG/CHANGELOG, LESSONS retains oldest-top per ADR-29
- This JOURNAL.md created with full historical backfill (10 entries, repo creation through today)

**Failed:**
- Audit hallucination N1: deep cleansing audit fabricated specific file metadata (1019 lines, exact filename) for a file that does not exist on disk and has no git history. Discovered via filesystem check + git log verification. Finding marked INVALID (`1d4f3af`); audit reliability flagged. Lesson appended to LESSONS.md.
- Tier 3 Prompt 2 session summary listed 4 items as PENDING that were actually already done in same session (R1/R3/N1/E1). Acknowledged after Rob's pushback. Cause: had git log visible, didn't cross-check before listing pending. Pattern: model produces plausible-looking state claims that read as confirmed evidence.
- Initial JOURNAL backfill prompt halted at Step 1 pre-write after archaeology revealed PLAYBOOK already formally documents JOURNAL.md at three locations with deliberate contradictory spec (oldest-top, Did/Failed/Next, per-session, Scale-conditional). Surfaced conflict, prompt re-issued with PLAYBOOK ordering amendment included.

**Next:**
- CHANGELOG Path B entry (MEDIUM gap — substantive content changes uncovered)
- Handoff doc `docs/handoffs/2026-04-26-stream-c-session-1-branch-convention.md` append items 21-26 covering today's 6 unlogged Krok 3 bonus-scope work areas
- README "Current state (2026-04-26)" date refresh to 2026-04-27 (LOW cosmetic)
- H1 audit finding (HANDOFF_PROCESS path template) — Krok 5 deferred
- 34 stale feature branches from Streams A/B — future hygiene pass
- Stream C session 2: file naming convention (per Stream C plan)

(refs: 39 commits today; 16 files modified; `docs/handoffs/2026-04-26-stream-c-session-1-branch-convention.md`; audit docs `2026-04-27-deep-cleansing-diagnostic.md` + `2026-04-27-numbers-audit.md`)

### 2026-04-26 | Stream B close + Stream C session 1 — ADR-30 default branch + PLAYBOOK Repo conventions skeleton

**Did:**
- HANDOFF_PROCESS.md v1.1 amendment — 3 artifacts not 1 per Vibe Code 4 protocol patch (`ee7e644`, `4055006`)
- Stream B → Stream C handoff document created (`16bb05c`, see `docs/handoffs/2026-04-26-stream-b-complete-stream-c-scope.md`)
- 8 lessons promoted from CHANGELOG to LESSONS.md as standalone pre-work before session 1 ADR-30 work (`aa6b34f`, branch `chore/lessons-promotion-stream-b-leftovers`)
- ADR-30 created — universal `main` default branch rule for all Rob's repos (`2b337bf`, see `docs/decisions/ADR-30_default_branch_main.md`)
- PLAYBOOK "Repo conventions" section added with 5-subsection skeleton: 1 filled (Default branch), 4 TBD with forward-references to ADR-31/32/33/34 (`274221b`)
- README ADR count updated (`341548c`); CHANGELOG Stream C session 1 entry (`415f275`); HANDOFF_PROCESS + prompt-template master→main updates (`7289cdd`); ADR-30 prompt-template "Merge to master" prose fix (`3a2bf18`); PLAYBOOK ADR-32 placeholder wording standardized (`fabb6eb`)
- `.dev-knowledge` repo renamed master→main (Phase 2; remote rename N/A — local-only repo)
- Codex audit of ADR-30 work (`bc85704`, see `docs/audits/2026-04-26-codex-adr-30-default-branch-main.md`)
- 8 commits on `feat/adr-30-default-branch-main`, merged via `9df901e`
- Stream C session 1 handoff document created with full 11-session plan (`3c97dd2`, see `docs/handoffs/2026-04-26-stream-c-session-1-branch-convention.md`)

**Failed:**
- Codex audit found 1 Medium ("Merge to master" prose in prompt-template) — fixed in `3a2bf18`. 2 Low findings: Finding 1 accepted as deliberate extended ADR schema, Finding 2 fixed in `fabb6eb`.
- Phase 2 master→main rename reduced scope: Steps 11-14 (push/delete/GitHub UI) N/A — `.dev-knowledge` is local-only repo, no remote configured. First full-flow validation deferred to Stream C sprint 1 (corp-monorepo + ai-council).

**Next:**
- Stream C session 2: file naming convention (per 11-session plan)
- Sprint 1 (session 4): per-repo branch renames + corp-monorepo `.claude/settings.local.json` audit
- Council #27 filter-by-tag rule — UNRESOLVED follow-up (logged in handoff item 17)

(refs: `docs/handoffs/2026-04-26-stream-c-session-1-branch-convention.md`; ADR-30; Codex audit `docs/audits/2026-04-26-codex-adr-30-default-branch-main.md`)

### 2026-04-25 | Stream B implementation marathon — 19 of 19 gaps closed + 1 amendment

**Did:**
- Stream B gaps mapping audit — 19 gaps with placement + dependencies (`5aa3b35`, see `docs/audits/2026-04-24-stream-b-gaps-mapping.md`)
- Gap #6 AGENTS.md template + canonical governance section (`ed82b46`, `f3d981a`); template renamed to codex-review-config-template.md after purpose clarification (`c9d6c07`, `e838b1a`)
- Gap #1 Roles section v1.0 in ESSENTIALS — browser/Claude Code division (`54d7289`)
- Validator/hook H3 divergence discovered + fixed: validator no-args fallback (`446abbe`); validator/hook alignment on heading level scope (`7eaa2c2`)
- Gap #5 CLAUDE.md template v1.0 (thin pointer, hybrid pattern) + PLAYBOOK section (`001fbb2`, `e87525d`)
- Gap #2 + #3 prompt template v1.0 + writing prompts PLAYBOOK section (`1bd4442`, `76af001`)
- Gap #4 + #18 PLAYBOOK Documentation file types and session continuity section — 12-file taxonomy + Scale matrix + 4 common confusions + order conventions (`9a0ed10`)
- Gap #11 HANDOFF_PROCESS.md v1.0 — Vibe Code 4 protocol; handoff-prompts aligned (`5c3ddb5`, `b45a9b5`)
- Gap #12 + #19 PLAYBOOK — Council vs single-model + critic gating; amendment vs reopen decision protocol (`bc4946b`, `6145b8c`)
- Gap #13 PLAYBOOK session boundaries section v1.0 (`80fac2f`)
- Gap #15 + #16 PLAYBOOK — testing rules per Scale tier; Codex review archival protocol (`5aecf57`, `370cf16`)
- Gap #17 PLAYBOOK Continuous Improvement section v1.0 (`0e9105a`); validator skip pattern for docs/tech-radar/ added (`3088a2d`)
- Gap #7a-d PLAYBOOK Claude Code internals section v1.0 (`9a31446`); Gap #7d amendment — subagents factually active (`3860d4d`, `f008489`)
- Gap #10 PLAYBOOK adoption protocol for Claude Code extensions (`8dfe69c`)
- Gap #8 VS Code workspace templates S/M/L (`0b00f70`, `2d890a9`, `05d08a2`) + PLAYBOOK section (`4be065c`)
- Gap #9 Claude Code features inventory audit (`271d6d6`, see `docs/audits/2026-04-25-claude-code-features-inventory.md`); tech-radar cross-link (`a684fc1`)
- Stream B COMPLETE: 19/19 gaps + 1 amendment (`1c9ff9a`)

**Failed:**
- Validator/hook H3 divergence discovered during Gap #1 work — manual validator passed but pre-commit hook failed on H3 tags. Root cause: hook called validator with no args; validator's no-args fallback was vacuous-pass instead of scanning all in-scope files. Fixed in same session.
- Gap #7d initial pass missed that subagents are factually active per `~/.claude/agents/` — amendment commit added explicitly noting this.
- AGENTS.md mental model reverted twice in 48h despite docs documenting reconciliation — logged as lesson candidate (mental model drift after recent reconciliation).

**Next:**
- Stream B → Stream C handoff (Gap #18 amendment candidate: Scale matrix recalibration based on actual project sizes)
- Stream C scope definition + session 1 planning

(refs: `docs/audits/2026-04-24-stream-b-gaps-mapping.md`; `docs/audits/2026-04-25-claude-code-features-inventory.md`; CHANGELOG entries 2026-04-25)

### 2026-04-24 | Stream A close + plumbing — ratio-aware enforcement, ADR-27 amendment, TOKEN-LOG cadence, scope-tag rollout

**Did:**
- Research archival (`ccc91d6`, `71ca513`); Council #28/#29 transcripts + research archived (`731cf9d`, `292a4a7`); 7 historical Council debates retroactively archived (`802a533`); README.md created for `docs/research/` and `docs/decisions/` (`60ee717`)
- Council archival protocol added to PLAYBOOK Section 5 (`bd5e6c5`)
- Stream A gap report created with supersession note on consolidated actions (`6945921`); repo sync + CHANGELOG + CLAUDE.md (`4bc8859`)
- PLAYBOOK Phase 2 tagging sanity check (Stream A prompt 3.5) — 5 top-level scope tags corrected on S4/S6/S7/S14/S15 + cascade inherit-parent fixes (`85190db`, `c3f8e0d`, `f3e1956`, `2bb5528`)
- Phase 2 audit applied — sections tagged in ESSENTIALS, SESSION_SETUP, HANDOFF_PROCESS, ENVIRONMENT (`fd96b5a`, `8a25a19`, `bcd0c36`, `b533d12`)
- ADR-29 amendment — file-level scope tag for LESSONS, [scope: X] inline format for new entries (`b0df750`, `296767a`, `8013d9c`, `496c9f0`)
- ADR-27 amendment — commit-time enforcement prescription (ratio-aware, `aec1a4b`); validator implementation (`b54cddd`); unit tests (`3987348`); ruff + decimal precision fixes (`c02e57e`, `9ea94d3`, `8c5ea66`)
- Stream A CLOSED — gap report marked complete, lessons extracted (`19d6516`, `f0702f2`)
- LESSONS 50-entry split deferred with rationale (`eaf3f53`); 2026-04-21 inventory marked SUPERSEDED (`b940661`); ADR-27 filename simplified (`722960b`); handoff/ → handoff-prompts/ rename (`a65b495`)
- README user-first rewrite reflecting post-Stream-A state (`093d545`)
- ccusage tool adopted — TOKEN-LOG snapshot (`2fe0b99`); ENVIRONMENT documentation (`c6f3351`); PLAYBOOK reference (`6db896f`)
- TOKEN-LOG cadence formalized (`eb7cc03`, `7d6e51a`); TOKEN-LOG order flipped to newest-first matching CHANGELOG convention (`43eb577`, `7d8219a`)
- ESSENTIALS data sanitization rule for lessons (`8605202`); validator rename-collision lesson + file-level tag pattern lesson (`717d649`)

**Failed:**
- Validator rename collision: handoff/ → handoff-prompts/ rename initially broke validator's path resolution. Fix: file-level tag pattern documented as workaround, lesson appended.
- Original ADR-27 prescription was flat 25% blocking; turned out to cause "stuck above ceiling" failure mode. Amended to delta-rule (blocks regressions only).

**Next:**
- Stream B scope mapping (became 2026-04-25 marathon)
- Per-Scale Stream B gap implementation

(refs: `docs/audits/2026-04-24-stream-a-gap-report.md`; ADR-27 amendment; ADR-29 amendment; CHANGELOG entries 2026-04-24)

(refs: `docs/audits/2026-04-21-corp-monorepo-operating-model-analysis.md`)

---

### 2026-04-22 | ADR-27 + ADR-29 created + validator scaffolding

**Did:**
- ADR-27 Council #27 scope tagging architecture (binding, Council 4/5 consensus, Option A) — five tag values dev/llm/hybrid/runtime/meta, pre-commit enforcement, evidence-triggered reopening (`b878cce`, see `docs/decisions/ADR-27_scope-tagging.md`)
- ADR-29 LESSONS.md grandfathering (binding, derivative of ADR-27) — existing entries untouched, [scope: X] inline field on new entries (`00e4467`, see `docs/decisions/ADR-29_lessons-grandfathering.md`)
- CHANGELOG sync 2026-04-21 ADR-27 + ADR-29 (`f0bc0e3`)

- `.dev-knowledge` inventory audit (`2fd99c5`, see `docs/audits/2026-04-21-dev-knowledge-inventory.md`)
- Phase 2 scope tagging audit — 63 sections classified across 8 primary files; distribution: 14% dev, 22% llm, 21% hybrid, 8% runtime, 35% meta (`0395a04`, see `docs/audits/2026-04-21-dev-knowledge-scope-tagging.md`)
- Council #27 brief — 3 architecture options with decision matrix (`bd0c9bb`); Option 0 added with honest LESSONS framing + matrix caveat (`2f287a6`)
- 2026-04-21 session handoff with dev-knowledge redefinition (`25808c3`)
- ADR-28 three-layer architecture (descriptive — browser → `.dev-knowledge` → projects) added to PLAYBOOK System Architecture section (`695e54c`, `0704f06`); Section 12 cross-ref (`4ace660`); CHANGELOG entry (`40a857d`)

- S15 + ESSENTIALS + CHANGELOG codex-review automation update (`9b5785a`)
- Codex review for smoke-test added then deleted (`88aa66a`, `49d6647`)

**Failed:**
- Codex review smoke-test audit added then deleted same-day — premature artifact, pattern not yet stable. Deleted before any consumers.

**Next:**
- ADR-27 from Council #27 (became 2026-04-22 work)
- ADR-29 LESSONS grandfathering (Council #27 raised this open question)
- Validator implementation (Phase 2 enforcement)

(refs: `docs/handoffs/2026-04-21-dev-knowledge-architecture-redefinition.md`; `docs/handoffs/2026-04-21-tech-radar-session.md`; `docs/audits/2026-04-21-council-27-brief.md`; ADR-28)

**Next:**
- Tech radar continuation (became 2026-04-21 session)
- Handoff process refinement (became 2026-04-21 work)
- Magistrala verification (carried as standing follow-up)

(refs: `docs/handoffs/2026-04-15-codex-tach-opus47-session.md`; `docs/handoffs/2026-04-15-tech-radar-session.md`)

### 2026-04-14 | Dev practice OS state audit

**Did:**
- Audit of dev practice OS state after 2026-03-30 session (`4ba0513`) — point-in-time snapshot before tooling evaluation work begins
